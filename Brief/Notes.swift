    Had to remove CoreML model from project. I realized I was using distilBERT which is
    a classification model. I tried to use distilBART, Pegasus, and others with varying difficulties.
    I am thinking about try to use Tabular Data and convert to a mlpackage from there. I am not sure
    if this will be easier or not but I think it's worth a shot.

    While removing the model and commiting to GitHub I encountered issues trying to push those
    changes. For some reason, the deleted files were still being tracked. This caused challenges in
    fixing the issue and somewehre a long the way my info.plist files in the main & share ext were broken/corrupted.
    Thankfully, I was able to recover. However, it delayed my progress by days.
