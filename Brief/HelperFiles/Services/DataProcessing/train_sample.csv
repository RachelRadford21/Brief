irascible the 27 yearold scot mentally and technically outmuscled tomas berdych in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth australian open final at the rod laver arena on thursday after a shaky start murray played superbly  as well as he has done since winning wimbledon  to advance 67 68 60 63 75 in three hours and 26 minutes video scroll down to watch australian open murray wins 67 68 60 63 75 against berdych  andy murray is through to the australian open final after beating tomas berdych in four sets in melbourne  murray shows his delight after booking his place in the australian open final for the fourth time in his career  murray and berdych shake hands after an intense semifinal showdown that lasted just shy of three and a half hours  murrays fiancee kim sears celebrates her partners victory on thursday at rod laver arena in melbourne  murray fought back from a set down to beat berdych 67 60 63 75 in a match that lasted almost three and a half hours  murray will play either novak djokovic or stanislas wawrinka in the australian open final on sunday in melbourne  there was little love lost in a contest which was transformed after berdych said something at the changeover following the first set that clearly riled murray it had been boiling up before then and even the normally demure kim sears became unusually animated caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters box murray admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all given that he was in opposition to his excoach dani vallverdu for the first time he drew on that as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponents box it might have been habit but probably not there was a little bit of extra tension it was a big match said murray a lot was made of dani working with him we have been friends since we were 15 years old i thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there everyone calmed down after a bit murray looked in supreme form again  as he has done for the past fortnight over in melbourne  dani vallverdu murrays former coach watches on from berdychs box and murray admitted that added extra tension murray gestures after losing the opening set on a tiebreak after fighting back from 53 down  the sun peaks through on a mild australian evening in melbourne as thousands watch inside the rod laver arena  berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy murray i really remember it well i say to myself well done tomas thats it i think im allowed to do that when i win a set what i have to be worried about every word i am going to say i just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair maybe next time i should stay even more calm and thats it it was a great battle a good match unfortunately with a bad end for me murray the 27 yearold scot also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of amelie mauresmo saying a lot of people criticised me working with her and i think so far this week weve shown that women can be very good coaches as well madison keys who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in lindsay davenport and i see no reason why that cant keep moving forward like that in the future im very thankful for amelie for doing it it was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully i can repay her in a few days murray fought back in the second set  beating berdych to love in a stunning half hour of tennis  murray had plenty of british supporters in the crowd as he looked to progress to the final  berdych celebrates winning the first set after holding his nerve in the tiebreak  the no 6 seed added i was obviously disappointed to lose the first set i had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 55 i felt like i started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set i changed tactics a little bit but also i was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that tomas hits in the second set i made him do most of the running i started dictating the points getting the first strike in after losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back the reward is a fiendishly tough final against either the world no 1 novak djokovic or defending champion stan wawrinka who face off on friday murray will have an extra day to recover although historically that has never been a huge advantage here murray had to hurdle some advertising hoardings during an intense third set  which he eventually won  murrays fiancee sears watches on nervously at rod laver arena as the semifinal unfolds on thursday  ester satorova was also there to cheer on her fiancee berdych  but he ultimately went down to murray  singer kenny rogers and former player evonne goolagong cawley watched on from the stands as murray progressed comfortably  on whether he would be watching their semifinal murray said i will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here i might be in bed before theyre finished so far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky less contentiously than the spats there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of murrays career the scots first serve was excellent particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court his movement was superb and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in czech around the baseline a tendency of berdych has been to serve in a predictable fashion and when he tried to push murray wide with the serve the british no 1 was more agile to respond and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards berdych the perennial nearly man could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician murray who is now in his eighth grand slam final the czech didnt get a sniff after winning the tiebreak with murray far too strong for him  murray pulled berdych apart after losing the first set and goes into his fourth australian open final  wimbledon 2013  beat novak djokovic 64 75 64  australian open 2013  lost to novak djokovic 76 67 36 26  us open 2012  beat novak djokovic 76 75 26 36 62

desk  some employees act like a teenager whose parents are out of town they sneak out early or come in late they chitchat with coworkers more frequently usually about nonworkrelated things they make personal phone calls take extralong lunches  heck maybe theyll even enjoy a cocktail with their meal many employees do it  but why the answer is simple its a direct reflection of the bosss leadership when a workplace isnt compelling to people  where employees lack the desire and ability to be accountable for their own success  misbehaving or slacking in the bosss absence is merely a mask for boredom its also important feedback for the boss raise your game says linda galindo a consultant specializing in individual and leadership accountability and the author of the 85 solution how personal accountability guarantees success we asked employees what they do when the boss isnt looking they had some very entertaining stories  at the time i was an assistant manager at publix supermarkets of florida not content with the absolute misery of the hourly employees i was responsible for i tried to inspire and entertain them it worked those under me had the highest productivity rate got the best raises were promoted faster and would do just about anything in the world for me because they knew i would do anything in my power for them while this usually meant me working alongside them or personally training them for continuous quality improvements it occasionally took on a slightly wilder side riding a motorcycle through the store aisles after closing bowling for twoliter soda bottles with frozen turkeys baseball in the stockroom laser tag on the roof contests to see who could catch the most shoplifters hide and seek a chess tournament foot races pizza parties karate training book club and a few hundred practical jokes   jolson  ive been building my lifecoaching business for over a year while ive held down an executive assistant job from 96 monday through friday the boss works across the street from the office that im at and i spend the majority of my day at least four hours maybe more building my coaching business  posting to my blog tweeting communicating with clients writing newsletters even doing sessions during my lunch  break  you name it thankfully its paid  off  im giving notice in about a month to coach fulltime   mw when i worked at this pizza shop myself and two fellow employees would try to make each other laugh by making faces behind the boss for example i would be running the oven and the boss would be right next to me so if i laughed i was screwed so my friend x would be at the cook line about 2 feet behind my boss so i can see him and the boss couldnt and the facial expressions and motions he would make were hilarious i must say i never saw him get caught   mw my story has more to do with a colleague who always has some very important thing to do at homewith the babyhis elderly motherinlaw or has a sudden urgent need to deliver something to one of our member organizations that takes him out of the office for long stretches of time when the executive director is away recently when the boss went on an extended holiday around christmasnew years i and another colleague kept a spreadsheet of this slackers arrivals lunch breaks and departures and then averaged out the numbers all told he was in the office an average of 55 hours a day while the boss was away and given all the adorable postings i see on facebook from him every night i imagine theres at least another hour in there taken up in facebook upkeep and web browsing   dc to be honest before i became a boss and i worked for someone else i did some of everything when the boss was a way from surfing the internet to making personal calls and paying bills to taking an extra hour at lunch to going home early to sleep ive even made out with a woman or two at the office  jd i know what one of my employees was doing when i was out of the office or at meetings she was on facebook a few vendors told me about it privately so i set out to bust her in the act i invited her to become my facebook friend and she took the bait then i wrote her up and attached the summary of the days and times she was commenting on her facebook page which was during business hours while i was away i dont particularly like writing up employees but i loved this write up with the facebook evidence attached   kpw  when our bosses arent looking or even better when they walk away and leave their computers unlocked someone sneaks in and sends a short email to someone else in the office these emails range from the quirky to the flirtatious to the potentially insulting but they are always good for a laugh at least as long as the boss still isnt looking  td i work in a small doctors office with only one doctor my office manager is very cool and participates in our slacking when the doc or his wife are not around and we dont have any patients  we make fun of the doc and his wife when we make fun of our bosses we really make fun of them and create scenarios that we act out we raise our voices to impersonate them and when we laugh we laugh really loud we also order food during lunch and eat it in the waiting room where we have a tv computers and internet something that is not allowed during work hours we snoop on the docs computer we always catch him on the internet so we like to see what he does on the computer all the time needless to say we found porn in his favorites also his wife forgets to sign out of her email dont ask me why but everyone uses the computers so we saw in her email a message that read thank you for signing up to lesbian porn   vanessa  for the past two years ive been selfemployed but before i started my company i always enjoyed reading news articles on the internet during the day my project managers often frowned upon us surfing the internet during the day but i found a creative way around this at the beginning of the day id find interesting articles online and copy and paste the text into a word document the word document had the company logo in the header so if somebody walked by my cube it would appear that i was reading an official workrelated document rather than the top sports news of the day   sm i have a coworker who is two completely different people when our boss is out of the office when she is in he makes sure to get to work before her and leave after her even though he is just messing around on skype and youtube all day long she took a oneweek vacation in august and he worked 95 every day our hours are 800 to 630 then he put the icing on the cake in the week after christmas most of our team was out of town including our boss apparently he thought he was going to be the only one in the office and didnt even come in to work hed occasionally send out an email to make it seem like he was there finally on the wednesday after christmas he strolled in around 1100 am when he saw another team member was here he turned beet red and stammered how he thought she was out for the week no one has said anything to our boss yet but we are dying to  jj i placed an online order to american apparel to restock my underwear supply instead of shipping them to my house i had them shipped to the office  more reliable when the package arrived i couldnt wait to see what the panties looked like on literally i couldnt wait i didnt even take time to close my office door i pulled out the first pair light blue thong lifted up my skirt and pulled the panties over my leggings they were cute unfortunately just at that moment my boss arrived at my door  a 60yearold man face to face with a 28yearold female employee it wasnt good next time ill wait until hes out of the office to try on my

02a300f080fbcc72542d250b40220919af9d0c27,alex salmond today conceded there are alternative  options to the british pound as the crisis deepened over his plans for an  independent scotlands currency the first minister denied that he does not have a backup  plan signalling that he could go into this years referendum with a proposal  for a new scottish currency but mr salmond is coming under intense pressure to reveal  his chosen plan b with the countrys top business leaders demanding answers under pressure alex salmond said other options were presented by the scottish governments fiscal commission working group  which included a new scottish currency the row comes after chancellor george osborne shadow  chancellor ed balls and libdem treasury chief danny alexander this week  comprehensively rejected any deal to share the pound in a currency union with  a separate scotland the gamechanging move has left the nationalists in  disarray just seven months before scotlands future is decided on september 18 mr salmond said other options were presented by  the scottish governments fiscal commission working group  which included a  new scottish currency either with a fixed exchange rate to the pound or a  floating exchange rate a scottish pound could be pegged on a onetoone basis  with the british pound in the way the irish pound was until 1979 there would  be a scottish central bank to replace the bank of england to ensure the  credibility of the currency and there would need to be large reserve of  sterling mr salmonds fiscal commission found last year in the long  run the creation of a new scottish currency would represent a significant  increase in economic sovereignty however it would be a major challenge to decide how  contracts savings pensions and salaries would be converted at the start into  values in the new currency keeping millions of british pounds in reserve would  also limit scottish ministers ability to invest in public services and if the markets were unsure about a new scottish  currency a premium could be added to interest rates  forcing scots to pay  more for loans and mortgages mr osborne used a speech in edinburgh to insist the currency was not like a cd collection to be divided up in the event of a messy divorce during an exchange on bbcs good morning scotland first minister alex salmond was keen to stress there were alternatives to an independent scotland keeping the pound  bbcs jim naughtie does that mean in the event of a yes vote you go into negotiations without another option in your back pocket alex salmond well let me say for the third time jim that the fiscal commission working group set out all of the monetary policy options for an independent scotland but recommended the best one was a sterling area and thats the one that were going to be articulating and thats what youd expect us to do naughtie ok alex salmond says there is no alternative salmond no i didnt say that jim i said naughtie im just checking salmond try again i said the fiscal commission working group set out a range of monetary policy options for an independent scotland other currency options include unilaterally choosing to use  the pound with no control over monetary policy  adopting a formula used by  panama east timor and the federated states of micronesia yesterday a graphic  appeared on yes scotlands facebook page which stated an independent scotland  would not need westminsters permission to continue using the pound or a separate scottish government could try to persuade  european nations to let the country join the euro  which was once mr salmonds  favoured option mr salmond was interviewed on bbc radio show good morning  scotland after spending much of thursday at his aberdeenshire home  and avoiding the tv cameras as his independence plans crumbled around him the first minister was asked by presented jim naughtie if he  would go into negotiations following a yes victory without another option in  your back pocket the fiscal commission working group set out all of the  monetary policy options for an independent scotland but recommended the best  one was a sterling area and thats the one were proposing and that were  going to be articulating and thats what youd expect us to do mr salmond  replied ok alex salmond says there is no alternative mr naughie  continued before the snp leader interrupted him and said no i didnt say  that jim mr naughtie then challenged the first minister so there is  an alternative what is it the fiscal commission working group set out a range of  options mr salmond conceded asked if the options were off the table the first  minister added theyre in the fiscal commission working group theyre there  and have been there for the past year mr osborne said it is clear that as chancellor he could not recommend that the uk could share the pound with an independent scotland  conservative chancellor george osborne the  evidence shows it wouldnt work it would cost jobs and cost money and  wouldnt provide economic security for scotland or for the rest of the  uk people need to know  that is not going to happen lib dem chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander this isnt bluff or bullying its a  statement of fact the snps claims that an independent scotland could  or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction labour shadow chancellor ed balls  youd be trying to negotiate a monetary union as scotland is pulling  away from the uk it wont happen i wouldnt recommend it scotland  will not keep the pound if scotland chooses independence former chancellor alistair darling said the  penny has dropped for alex salmond  he knows he cannot promise the pound alex salmond is offering us one of two options a rush to  join the euro or a separate unproven currency both currency options would be  bad for jobs as every time we sold to our biggest customer england scottish  firms would need to pay the costs of changing currency scottish libdem leader willie rennie said the first  minister has effectively conceded that the sterling currency with the uk will  not happen he pointed towards the options in his fiscal commission but  he needs to tell us which one hed choose would it be the euro or a separate  scottish currency the clock is ticking owen kelly chief executive of scottish financial enterprise   whose members include lloyds banking group rbs aviva and standard life   added it is as clear as it can be at this stage that a currency union is not  an option for an independent scotland it would now be prudent for businesses to consider the  specific effects adopting remaining options could have on their business,"first minister insists he has a backup plan if voters back independence

former republican presidential candidate mitt romney appeared on face the nation sunday to critique that plan 
romney said the president should take a breath and work with republicans to find a longterm solution to the issue both parties can agree on"

seemingly caused by obamacare while the presidents signature policy promised that no one with a preexisting condition would not be covered the affordable care act has seemingly caused the sevenyearold gainesville texas boy to face an agonizing wait for treatment as his parents battle to get him back on his insurance plan why would you cancel a kid asked his mother krista alford i really want to send obama and all of them pictures of my son he has scars all over his head he doesnt want to leave the house because hes afraid people are going to make fun of him because hes bald desperate hunter alford needs treatment for his rare cancer but has been left uninsured after a administrative glitch caused by the introduction of obamacare  tragic while the presidents signature policy promised that no one with preexisting condition would not be covered the affordable care act has seemingly caused the sevenyearold gainsville texas boy to lose his insurnance  while mom krista and dad ron go out their minds with worry hunter  who was born with an extremely rare form of cancer called plexiform hishocyne neoplasm   is battling the disease which has now spread to his brain but after seven years of fighting his illness hunters insurance has been canceled and he is due his next round of chemo which costs 50000 and right now krista says he is unlikely to get it the alfords are battling with childrens medicaid or chip  which insures hunter and despite the family receiving a new renewed insurance card they were informed that their agency had dropped them i called them and they said we were dropped october 31st krista said to news 12 she was told that her sons information was lost when administrative changes were made under the affordable care act the ladys like the only way we can expedite is if your son was pregnant and in labor or if he was an illegal krista said the parents said hunter has known nothing other than hospitals doctors sickness and pain distraught mother krista has been left out of her mind with worry by the loss of hunters insurance and the bureaucratic minefield she is having to through to fix it  krista was incredulous when she received a letter in november from her insurance provider asking why her son  who has been covered by them his entire life  was in hospital in the first place krista reasoned that after sevenyears of paying for his medical bills the insurance company would have a good idea of what was wrong with him despite kristas insistence that the affordable care act has caused her son to be uninsured a media spokesperson with texas health and human services communication  who handle chip  said that the problem does not lie with obamacare however she did admit to administrative changes that could have led to mistakes moving hunter from chip to an upgraded version of medicaid she repeated that the problem was not related to obamacare but there  were some glitches in coverage when the changeover happened ron alford with his daughter makayla and son hunter  he is a police officer in gainsville and struggling to get his children the health care they have been insured for their entire lives  however it seems that one of those glitches caused a little boy with lifethreatening cancer to lose his health insurance over the past month krista has been stuck in a bureaucratic hell  being passed from one agency telephone helpline to the next each one has brought her no closer to an answer or a resolution krista said shed had hunters current insurance for a yearandahalf and had never received any notice that she needed to requalify her children because of obamacare when she phoned to complain krista says all of a sudden could not find my son case at all and then she transferred me over to another gentleman who found his case he said it was hidden because when they switched over to hhsc texas health and human services commission they lost a lot of cases files and hunters was just one of those the more she asked the more confusing the answers became then they told me october 17th was when he was actually canceled but on october 25 he had chemo and they paid for it so i am getting different stories tough hunter has been ill his entire life and needs another round of chemotherapy to battle his rare form of cancer  the latest development in the shocking case is one that the wife of a small town police officer finds hard to believe now the new story with chip is they called and said my husband makes too much money 173 too much so im very upset i was bawling on the phone with her and the only thing she said was have a nice day and she hung up to make matters worse the alfords have been told that their sons cancer is not only rare but behaving in an unusual manner these tumors are very rare they are not supposed to spread but his decided they were going to spread and it can go into his lungs because the tumors like soft tissue and your lungs are soft tissue with hunter desperately in need of a new round of chemotherapy krista has said the family have no choice but to accept the massive 50000 bill for it with no insurance however they have set up a fund for people to help  heroes for hunter and so far they have raised 11005  but everything will help,"a gainesville texas family is fighting for their cancerstricken childs life after he was removed from his insurance plan

for north london this week these days i play for glory said the belgian as quick witted as it was acerbic kompanys tweet made his point the landscape has shifted in english football over the last five years you no longer sign for arsenal if you want to win the barclays premier league any time soon even the ever optimistic kompany will find little glory in his own teams predicament at the moment however as the city captain does his best to steady a defence currently looking as vulnerable as at any time since arab money eased his club on to an upwards trajectory six years ago manchester city captain vincent kompany failed to deal with the threat of twogoal hero seydou doumbia  belgium international kompany pictured with cska moscows alan dzagoev struggled against the russians  manuel pellegrinis side have not been at their best during this seasons champions league campaign  kompany reflected on his sides performance shortly after the final whistle  football is cyclical of course few things at the really top clubs last forever and city have too many good players in their squad for their current struggles to last having said that they are currently showing few signs of digging themselves out of a defensive slump that threatens to undermine their whole season manchester city have tried to pair vincent kompany with a number of centre backs during his time at the club but have had little success the likes of kolo toure joleon lescott and stefan savic have all been given a chance to hold down a starting berth alongside kompany  but have all since moved on to pastures new eliaquim mangala who sealed a 32million move to the etihad during the summer transfer window had expected to bolster citys defensive options but is yet to impress there are other issues currently afflicting this city team too many of their marquee players are lacking form they miss a reliable third striker after the departure of alvaro negredo on the back of his wifes homesickness in the summer nevertheless the sickness that currently drags them down is undoubtedly their work without the ball their defending even the best attacking teams need a platform on which to work and at the moment city just dont have one city were as poor as they have been for many years on wednesday night in that area of the field and there would appear to be a selfbelief issue confidence  that intangible sporting elixir  can hide a multitude of sins equally when it leaves you it can turn very good players in to shadows of themselves look for example at the two first half goals conceded by pellgrinis team here kompany looked dejected after his side loss 21 against champions league opponents cska moscow  the manchester city defender was not happy with the performance of referee tasos sidiropoulos  martin demichelis pictured and eliaquim mangala have taken it in turns to partner kompany  the first  a free header from a freekick  was the type of goal sunday league defenders would go to the pub and fret about the second meanwhile began with a botched clearance from gael clichy and ended with a run from cska forward seydou doumbia that was just too welltimed for the city leftbacks malfunctioning colleagues to do anything about there were other horror moments too between his two goals doumbia raced clear on joe hart with far too much ease on that occasion he was let down by a poor first touch and a shot pulled across goal and wide then shortly after cskas second goal the talented cska midfielder bebras natcho turned away from yaya toure so effortlessly that it was embarrassing luckily for city he couldnt supplement that act with a pass of similar quality lets not be too hard on toure the city midfielder has had a tough week and scored a sublime freekick equaliser early in the piece his subsequent sending off  as deserved as it was  was simply born of frustration former porto defender mangala has failed to live up to his 32million price tag  piers morgan took to twitter on tuesday to ask kompany if he would join his beloved arsenal  morgan then joked he had withdrawn his offer after the manchester city stars performance against cska  city lost their discipline here despite their numerical disadvantage they could have chased this game down they had enough quality left on the field there is a distinct lack of joy about this team at the moment though and it must be said their manager is showing few signs of finding answers we have all watched this group of players often enough over the recent months and years to know what they are really capable of they can be a pretty fearsome destructive force at the moment though they look vulnerable and fretful and it is surprising certainly across the back it would help if pellegrini could field a settled back four and in particular a regular central partnership injuries to summer signing eliaquim mangala  back on the bench against cska moscow  and aleksandar kolarov have deprived him of that option though and for now he must muddle on the champions league looks beyond city already if things dont improve soon the premier league will follow suit by the time the christmas trees go up video

019e95e15209076bbfd4315b86383883d9f0899d,cnn  just six weeks after the australian senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers a governmentappointed panel has recommended just that the threemember panel headed by former defense chief marshal houston made 22 recommendations monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year the reports release came after a particularly busy weekend for maritime authorities who intercepted six separate boats carrying a total of 265 people in the three days to sunday it also came as officials investigated claims a boat carrying more than 60 asylum seekers had disappeared en route from indonesia to christmas island a popular entry point to australias asylum system read more asylum seekers risking all to escape dangers of home  among the houston reports recommendations was that offshore processing centers be established on the islands of nauru and papua new guinea as soon as practical it also recommended an immediate increase in the number of people accepted each year for asylum from 13750 to 20000 in an effort to reduce the demand for family reunions it recommended barring people who arrive by boat from being able to sponsor their families to join them and rather than dumping the governments controversial and illegal malaysia solution the report recommended building on the deal through highlevel bilateral engagement focused on strengthening safeguards and accountability under the socalled malaysia solution australia would have sent 800 asylum seekers to malaysia for processing each year in exchange for 4000 confirmed refugees however the high court ruled the deal invalid last august on the grounds that as a nonsignatory to the 1951 un refugee convention malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers something required under australias migration act read more which countries take in most asylum seekers not the west  hours after the report was released gillard gave her inprinciple backing to all its recommendations and said that parliament would meet tuesday to amend the earlier rejected bill to include the provision for processing centers on nauru and png we will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion she added refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report calling it a rebadging of the pacific solution a reference to the former liberal governments controversial policy of the last decade at the heart of the panels report is the policy of deterrence but all deterrence does is divert people from our doorstep to dangers elsewhere it doesnt address the circumstances it just shifts the problem somewhere else said david manne executive director of australias refugee and immigration legal center what we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region there needs to be the understanding that it will take time perseverance and patience it will be incremental there are no simple solutions he added the socalled pacific solution was introduced by former prime minister john howard in 2001 and involved sending asylum seekers to detention centers on pacific island nations while their claims were processed the current labor government abandoned the policy when it took power in 2007 since then there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in australia between late 2001 and june this year 964 asylum seekers and crew died at sea of those more than 600 lost their lives in the last three years according to the report to do nothing is unacceptable  so we have proposed a new approach one that is comprehensive integrated and equitable said refugee expert and panel member paris aristotle in a statement amnesty internationals refugee spokesman graham thom said he was appalled by the panels recommendations sending asylum seekers to places like malaysia nauru and papua new guinea is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of australias human rights obligations the pacific solution was a failed policy and a wildly expensive one that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the worlds most vulnerable people he added manne said it was questionable whether nauru would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers although nauru and png have signed the refugee convention neither country has its own laws in place to protect refugees nor are there any proper legal guarantees that refugees would be protected and there are serious concerns about human rights conditions on the ground he said australias politicians have long been at odds over the countrys official response to asylum seekers while the opposition coalition has backed the reopening of offshore centers the move has been fiercely resisted by the greens party which claims it breaches human rights in late june the senate rejected the migration legislation amendment the bali process bill 2012 which would have allowed australia to send asylum seekers to malaysia and nauru for processing gillard said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue the panel estimated that if all the reports recommendations were adopted they would cost us1 billion to implement,"australian

slamming into that island manhattan vs irene it could happen sunday and hurricane experts are warning new yorkers that even though irene may not be a killer in the vein of katrina millions of people could be trapped in their homes for days without power transportation phones  and experience a hurricane warning was issued late friday afternoon for the new york city area as well as points eastward to cape cod massachusetts stoking fears that irene could be the most destructive hurricane to hit the metropolis since 1938 the basic issue is first new york city has worldclass emergency planners i mean theyre the best in the game but the city is out of practice when it comes to hurricanes said homeland security expert stephen flynn author of the edge of disaster but its not just new york that faces hurricane irenes wrath as it churns northward a heavily populated urban corridor from the nations capital to the new york metropolitan area stands a chance of a wet and windy lashing department of homeland security secretary janet napolitano warned that significant power outages are likely on the east coast this isnt a mammoth storm  in terms of lots of death and destruction but what it is going to do is be very disruptive and people have to be in position to camp out in their house flynn said time is always your ally before a disaster its always your enemy after a disaster he said using the time now to get prepared is key when you have that many people packed in a little space as dependent as they are on the transportation everybody has to get informed and get better prepared but a survey released friday indicated that the regions that are least likely to be prepared are urban areas in the northeast and many of them may be in the path of hurricane irene according to a cnnorc international poll 45 of americans say they have a stockpile of food and water in their homes in case of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake those figures are highest in the south and the west  where hurricanes and earthquakes are most frequent  but only 36 of northeasterners say they have emergency supplies of food and water people who live in rural areas are also more prepared than people who live in big cities only 42 in urban areas have a stockpile of food and water compared with 51 of rural residents in recent days though public officials have made frequent media appearances and taken other steps to indicate that they are ready for the storm that includes shutting down all public transportation in new york  including subways buses and commuter rails  after noon saturday gov andrew cuomo has also ordered the national guard to deploy up to 900 troops and most bridges in and around the city will be closed to traffic if winds exceed 60

our direction mandatory evacuations have been issued for some lowlying areas in all five of the citys boroughs including coney island in brooklyn far rockaway in queens and battery park city on the southern tip of manhattan some of those are patients in five hospitals eight nursing homes and other medical facilities that had to be moved out by 8 pm friday per the mayors orders in addition bloomberg said that 91 emergency facilities  which among other purposes will act as shelters  opened across the city its not just manhattan that will be tested flynn noted that long island home of the boroughs of queens and brooklyn and many other communities farther east has 75 million people crammed together if it were a state unto itself it would be the nations seventh largest  and one that likewise is facing a hurricane warning its an island the only way to get off and on to it is through the two boroughs and queens and the bronx and what we know is were going to have a lot of outages flynn said at 3 pm friday suffolk county ordered mandatory evacuations of barrier beach communities particularly those on the western end of fire island county spokesman mark smith said further evacuations in lowlying beachside communities  including parts of the hamptons and montauk  could be mandated saturday morning he added we expect long long delays as these roads start to get jammed east hampton town supervisor bill wilkinson said we are sitting at 125 miles in the atlantic and there are  from southampton to the end of long island  only two lanes if you have to get somewhere and you want to get home you better get on the road soon on fire island nervous residents put away outdoor furniture and the parking lot at costco was filled as shoppers stuffed suvs with bottled water and groceries transit systems in philadelphia and new jersey will also shut down saturday though the operators of bostons subway system vowed on friday to add extra resources and stay operational

were broken but what struck him most about seconds after asiana flight 214 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of san francisco airport was the silence none of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken boeing 777 no one from the cockpit announced anything  and now previously unseen pictures taken by levy in the confused aftermath have been released by the associated press ignoring his pain levy 39 rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed  losing its entire tail section escape in this saturday july 6 2013 photo provided by passenger benjamin levy passengers from asiana airlines flight 214 many with their luggage wait on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at san francisco international airport  we were left on our own said mr levy to the new york times there was no message from the pilot from the crew  there was no one levy ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane the wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach  making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway deciding not to exit the boeing 777 through that exit levy who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be survivor ben levy speaks about being aboard asiana flight 214 which crashed on saturday july 6th 2013 at san francisco international airport during an interview at his office in san francisco on tuesday july 9th 2013  ben levy right poses for photographs with his wife sumi lee levy as he wears a yellow ribbon put on by a firefighter on the tarmac for triage after asiana flight 214 crashed on saturday  he moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat  forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt she couldnt move said levy to the new york times there were two other guys we couldnt pick her up a firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered levy and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane which had now burst into flames people were pushing each other out there was a lot of commotion we got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out im so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly having landed at san francisco many times before levy told nbc bay area that he knew the approach was wrong fiery wreck the flight crashed upon landing and two of the 291 passengers aboard were killed  collecting their thoughts the passengers of asiana flight 214 hug each other after having survived the terrifying crash on saturday  as has transpired this was pilot lee kangkooks first landing at san francisco in a boeing 777 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft despite being an experienced boeing 747 pilot when he realized that he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late levy recalled in a phone interview with nbc bay area so we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again and then we landed again pretty hard it felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely he tried to correct which probably helped we would have hit the rocks as the planes belly skidded along the runway levy described the sheer terror inside it was surreal levy said a lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them i wasnt believing it either taken to san francisco general hospital levy was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family i am in pain but not too bad compared to other people he said adding on twitter of his actions just did what anyone in my position would have done help in this saturday july 6 2013 photo provided by passenger benjamin levy passengers from asiana airlines flight 214 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the san francisco international airport  despite levys assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found the bravery of cabin manager lee yoonhye the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped lee herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety despite suffering a broken tailbone that she didnt know she had until she was finally treated at san francisco hospital later while it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of asiana flight 214 survived it is most likely that one of the the two chinese teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane while a fire department spokeswoman said this on monday authorities are not saying if it was ye meng yuan and wang linjia both 16 who suffered the tragic accident head count the survivors of asiana flight 214 gather together on the tarmac of san francisco international airport after evacuating the boeing 777 which crashed on landing on saturday  the incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles mindy talmadge a spokeswoman for the san francisco fire department said yesterday in an interview with bloomberg most likely it was a fire vehicle but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete and it has been revealed today that six of the 29 students on the flight who were headed to california as part of a summer camp are now stuck in limbo as their passports were destroyed in the crash indeed the tour organizer adam yu believes that the entire camp will be scrapped and the children will return to china in the next few days the students and parents are missing each other he said to the daily beast they need a few days to recover theyre very emotional its best for them to

there are signs that the markets are improving reports  from the weekend suggested a 26trillion plan was being drawn up to allow greece to escape  repayment on half of its towering debt and to quadruple the size of  europes bailout fund the  international monetary fund imf has been coordinating talks with  leaders in washington and has reportedly drawn up a plan aimed at  providing a way for greece to manage a default on its debt which now  stand at 160 per cent of its gdp and banks rallied on hopes that a deal may be near with barclays the biggest ftse 100 riser up 7 per cent the ftse 100 index of leading shares opened down 2 per cent this morning but by the end of monday there was a 22 point rise  it  is thought the plan will include a 50 per cent write down to those debts  with private investors notably eurozone banks suffering huge losses on  the greek government debt they hold this morning the  ftse 100 index opened below 5000 after a drop of more than 90 points  but later recovered to stand 52 points higher at 51187  however by  closing the market was up 045 per cent or just 225 points european markets also moved forward  with both the cac40 in paris and dax in frankfurt posting gains of more  than 2 per cent despite a closely watched survey of german business  confidence sinking again in september louise cooper markets analyst at bgc  partners predicted a rollercoaster ride for markets while details of  the plan are thrashed out she said a sufficiently credible  plan to solve the eurozone crisis will necessitate changes to treaties  laws and not least the german constitution there will be wobbles and  uncertainty at every vote and stage of political implementation according the bbcs robert peston the deal could involve a writedown of half of greeces massive government debt but greek finance minister evangelos venizelos dismissed reports that he has discussed a scenario of an orderly default by athens with international monetary fund chief christine lagarde and european central bank head jeanclaude trichet we have reached a point where there are reports about what has been said in a closed door meeting with the participation of only mrs lagarde mr trichet and myself he said in a statement what is absolutely sure is that there hasnt been and couldnt have been any discussion about the socalled scenario of an orderly default however the international monetary  fund last night issued an extraordinary warning that it might not have  enough cash to stem the crisis engulfing the eurozone prompting fears  that britain could be forced to find billions more to bail out  debtstricken economies chancellor george osborne has refused to put british funds on the line for a new eu rescue scheme but he would be unable to resist a call from the imf to do more time for action chancellor george osborne left  will be under pressure to help fund the new scheme but his predecessor alistair darling right  says decisive action is needed  the dramatic development came as  france was forced to deny speculation that it is on the brink of having  to bail out its banking system emergency plans are being drawn up for a  26trillion deal aimed at saving the euro by allowing greece to default  on its massive debts the funds would be used to create a  firewall around the most indebted eurozone countries allow for an  orderly greek default on its towering debts and bail out those  european banks most at risk traders saw a further fall in the price of gold today as the traditional safe haven in times of economic turmoil continued its surprise descent the precious metal is down by more than 300 us dollars per ounce in the last three weeks from a record peak of 1921 us dollars an ounce on september 6 to less than 1600 us dollars today experts are at odds as to why gold and silver prices have fallen with some citing a drop in global price pressures and others saying the commodity has been overbought cme group the worlds largest futures market has also increased the minimum investment value to cover itself amid market uncertainty the recent dive in economic confidence should inspire a flight to gold  as the metal tends to outperform other commodities in times of crisis and also acts as a hedge against inflation julian jessop chief global economist at capital economics said two of the pillars that supported investors confidence in gold have been knocked away  namely fears of a surge in inflation and a collapse in the us dollar he said the 300 us dollar fall in the price of gold has caught most commentators by surprise  including us demand for gold as an inflation hedge has fallen as the global economy has slowed and other commodity prices have tumbled former  chancellor alistair darling warned yesterday that the world is facing a  bigger economic crisis than it did three years ago the greek crisis has been allowed  to run on and on and on mr darling said only this weekend it appears the governments have realised it is only a matter of time before greece defaults it is imperative the eurozone  countries take action now and not let it drag on for the next few weeks  because the risk is it will bring down other countries with it he added the situation today is more  serious than it was three years ago there are lessons to be learnt and  they are not being learnt by those responsible at the moment in  a bid to head off a wave of selling when stock markets reopen today  frances central bank insisted the countrys besieged lenders were  strong enough to withstand a greek debt default bank of france governor  christian noyer described as preposterous claims that french lenders  are facing a run on their deposits because of concerns over their  36billion  exposure to greece and he rejected reports that the french government was planning to use taxpayers cash to shore up the beleaguered banks mr  osborne has warned that europes political elite have just six weeks to  tame the debt storm engulfing the  17nation single currency  or risk  pitching the global economy back  into recession following  its meeting in washington the imf warned that it could run out of cash  if contagion spreads beyond the crippled periphery of the eurozone its  248billion bailout fund may not be big enough if the global economy  plunges into the mire because of the debt crisis according to imf chief  christine lagarde the  watchdogs current emergency fund looks comfortable today but pales in  comparison with the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries  and crisis bystanders mrs lagarde warned global  leaders are in a race against time to shore up  the eurozone and  prevent a greek default from triggering a fullblown financial meltdown we need a big bazooka said one senior official at the imf world bank chairman bob zoellick said  there is the looming danger that failure to take decisive action in  europe and the united states may shake the entire global economy

they had to stick to school rules over unsupervised explosives with kieras story in mind reddit users shared their worst experience of rules are rules being taken to the extreme by jobsworth managers

story about someone reacting badly to a show of social niceties someone at work sneezed and another  one said bless you a third party heard it and complained to hr about  it guy who said bless you was given a warning and had to take a  course in professionalism thats something most people  say as without thinking and they mean it in a good way one worker was given a warning for saying bless you to a sneezing colleague  one attorney told how they are not allowed to bring in soda to share with other employees because the office has a vending machine they also said that they have to tell their receptionist where they are going when they leave the office and inform her of their return im an attorney for christs sake i had more autonomy in undergrad they wrote one user who said they worked for the united states federal government said staff are not allowed to move their own furniture they wrote want to slide a desk across the room cant that is violating union rules and taking work away from the facilities team you have to call and schedule the movers then they charge you for it another government rule on food and personal items was proved to be bananas people used to keep snacks  on their desk while working because were human the employer  implemented lean working so every desk had to be totally empty except  for select items that had to be arranged in a certain way pens had to  be to the upper left of the keyboard i think this  rule forbid food items but allowed one personal item one staff  member had a banana in a banana case as her personal item she was told  to put it away one woman tried to get round the no food rule by claiming an inactive banana in a banana case was a personal item  she  refused and took it further until it was ruled that because she wasnt  eating it and the skin hadnt been broken it was an inactive banana and thus a personal item it only became active during the act of  eating at which point it became food a ritzy cafe had five separate

would have to go on vacation grow a stash and come back from our vacation with a fully grown moustache one warehouse wont relax the no hats rules for its bald workers  so on the next day we all showed up wearing fake moustaches one warehouse took its dress code too far according to another reddit commenter i work in a warehouse no hats its cold here in the winter and the poor bald guys cant wear hats stationery proved problematic too said one contributor we have to wear safety goggles when using a stapler at work due to an idiotic employee while one office doesnt trust its employee with water bottles  possibly because they think they will fill them with alcohol my place of employment only lets staff drink water from small cups and you must drink the whole cup immediately then dispose of the cup said another redditor you are not allowed to have water bottles on shift no matter which part of the store you are working in if you are on break unpaid time you cannot purchase a bottle of water even if you drink all of it and dispose of the bottle before you come back on shift an insurance company took punctuality to extremes you are allowed one fifteen minute break at 1030 you are

technology presents its own problems at my work there are signs on the printers that say the warranty will be void if the printer is turned off said another comment one office banned water bottles  only allowing workers to drink from a small cup  while the simple act of supplying the printer and fax machines had its own rules too moving a single box without a dolly was breaking the rules well

00fcb94b937a62afc6d4b8efac3828dbc1c78549,cnn  the wife of the president of oral roberts university is denying allegations of improper behavior saying the claims sicken her richard roberts and wife lindsay appear on cnns larry king live last week lindsay roberts in a statement on the universitys web site said the allegations against her sicken me to my soul  i live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply the suit filed earlier this month has drawn international attention to the private christian school in tulsa oklahoma founded by evangelist oral roberts father of university president richard roberts the new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors who say they lost their jobs after reporting that roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses the amended lawsuit filed friday also alleges that the university gave a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students while the man acted as a mentor the lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school the school denies both accusations in a statement on its web site the new allegations involving lindsay roberts come in a section titled scandal vulnerability assessment it says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the presidents residence and that she spent the night in the oru guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions it also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car timestamped after midnight despite a citywide 10 pm curfew for minors not with their parents the suit does not allege sexual behavior the suit says richard roberts sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence and a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position in her statement lindsay roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit the part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they dont even know if these allegations are true she said i believe its grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which i am not even named as a party other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the oru board of negligence it says that this past summer the board of regents allowed the president and the school to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university the man had previously confessed to crimes in courts in tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted the suit says in one of these convictions this mentor for oru students  reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction and under the direct supervision of president richard roberts  confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15yearold boy in a school locker room the suit says it also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on october 2 the board allowed oru and roberts to fire the schools financial comptroller after 26 years of service within hours voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed constituting spoilation of evidence according to witnesses the suit says beyond the online posting university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment monday by cnn the suit was filed by john swails tim brooker and paulita brooker who accuse richard and lindsay roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account using them for home renovations expensive vacations and clothes  allegations the robertses and the school have previously denied after complaining to the schools board of regents about university spending two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions so intolerable that he had no choice but to resign the lawsuit says one of the firings the suit says was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost who is named as a defendant the suit calls for actual damages in excess of 10000 and punitive damages also in excess of 10000 for each plaintiff as well as attorneys fees court costs and any further relief that the court deems just an equitable in an interview last week on cnns larry king live before the latest allegations were added to the suit richard roberts called it the most unusual thing ive ever witnessed in my life asked whether someone is out to get him he responded it sure seems that way lindsay roberts called the allegations preposterous the three plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit meanwhile accuse school officials of making libelous public remarks about them in an effort to discredit the lawsuit last week before the amended suit was filed the board vowed to hire an auditor to look into allegations made in regards to oral roberts university and certain members of the administration board chairman george pearsons said in an october 7 statement posted on the oru web site the oral roberts university board of regents is committed to operating the institution in accordance with all ethical legal and moral standards email to a friend,"suit filed by three profs who say oral

several people who had acute illnesses worried that they may have ebola said dr mark reiter he works as an emergency room doctor in tennessee hes also president of the american academy of emergency medicine reiter says these patients are unlikely candidates not having been to west africa nor having had any contact with a symptomatic ebola patient but it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it even if it is highly unlikely reiter said emergency rooms typically see a small uptick in traffic after a disease has been in the news a lot a 2010 study that looked at emergency room traffic when swine flu was in the news saw a 7 increase in emergency room visits parents must also have been worried about their children catching it as pediatric visits increased 197 a recent pew study showed 21 of respondents are somewhat worried about ebola and their personal health dr abdul memon the chief medical officer for disaster and emergency preparedness at jackson health system in miami said officials have not seen a significant patient increase with the ebola scare they do however get cases from time to time where people think they may have it the hospital is careful he said to rule it out our health department and the media does a really reasonable job of educating the community about how people get it memon said i think people are listening and we have not seen this rush of people if someone has had contact with someone who has ebola symptoms or they have been in one of these countries we want them to come in if they feel sick and we are ready for it we will pay close attention memon said the number of deaths attributed to the current ebola outbreak has topped 4000 the world health organization reported friday the latest count brings the total number of confirmed probable or suspected cases to 8399 and the total deaths to 4033 the numbers were reported from guinea liberia nigeria senegal sierra leone spain and the united states complete coverage on ebola  but along with news of the rising death toll some suspected ebola cases around the world  as fears spread across four continents  have turned out to be false concerns about protective measures especially for those caring for the infected remain high a total of 416 health care workers are among those believed to have contracted ebola of those 233 of have died the who says we just dont really know an american aid worker who contracted ebola in liberia and overcame the virus was said to have become infected while treating ebola patients there but she told cnn on friday that there is no way to be sure nancy writebol was working with samaritans purse in liberia caring for ebola patients when she became ill and was eventually transferred to an atlanta hospital where she recovered the belief has been that she contracted ebola while working in a clinic with infected patients but the survivor said that isnt necessarily the point of infection well its very possible that i contracted ebola outside of the medical unit not within writebol said of course i came in contact with people outside of our hospital and i remember knowing and being with a gentleman one time that later died of ebola and its possible that there was you know some contact there we just dont really know writebol was released from emory university hospital on august 19 once doctors determined she posed no public health threat her recovery has been gradual writebol said but she is gaining strength each day how the ebola virus spreads  the lack of clarity about where she became infected is significant as questions are raised worldwide about safety precautions at hospitals and communities as the outbreak stokes fears the sole person to be diagnosed with the virus on american soil thomas eric duncan died this week as new details of his hospitalization were revealed he had traveled from liberia last month duncan first went to the hospital on september 25

had a 103degree fever when he left the hospital according to the discharge papers talking to cnns erin burnett on friday night weeks alleged that the fact duncan was black poor and didnt have insurance affected his care had that been another or another color he probably would be living today he would have survived it weeks said and thats whats hurting me the most  they treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin you stand a chance if youre white but you dont if youre back while it hasnt responded to these latest allegations dallas texas health presbyterian hospital did issue a statement thursday explaining and defending its treatment of duncan why wasnt he immediately given an experimental drug because one wasnt available the hospital explained why didnt he get a blood transfusion like other ebola patients in the united states because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors and as to whether duncan got inferior treatment because of his nationality or wealth texas health presbyterian said more than 50 people cared for him and a 24bed intensive care unit was devoted to his care our care team provided mr duncan with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care the hospital said  we have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area suspected case comes back negative  on thursday a test to see whether a dallas sheriffs deputy had ebola came back negative state health officials said word of the test result was welcome news a day after the death of duncan the deputy had reported being inside the dallas apartment where duncan had been staying and having some contact with duncans family members frisco fire chief mark piland told reporters ebola spreads through infected bodily fluids the deputy michael monnig on friday spoke about awaking after having been on duty at duncans apartment feeling like a truck had hit me he identified them as flulike symptoms but following the guidance of the county doctor he went to the clinic and explained that he had been in the apartment at that point i knew all the bells and whistles would start up but at that point it was out of my control because i had answered yes to the question he said he broke down crying when he learned he didnt have ebola monnig said cdc director

066434e382fd3567927ce858b213b0b1338577a5,cnnthere is no evidence that anyone at the nfl saw or possessed a video showing ray rice punching his thenfiancée until it was made public but the league should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident an external investigative report released thursday concludes the report wraps up an inquiry by former fbi director robert mueller into how the nfl initially investigated the thenbaltimore ravens running backs attack on janay palmer last february at the revel casino hotel in atlantic city we concluded there was substantial information about the incident  even without the inelevator video  indicating the need for a more thorough investigation mueller said in his report the nfl should have done more with the information it had and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the february 15 incident the nfl asked for muellers report in september after a public outcry over nfl commissioner roger goodells handling of rices discipline while this investigation has now concluded our focus on the underlying issues and our commitment to positive change remain as strong as ever goodell said in a written statement we have all learned a great deal in the past months and expect to be judged by how we lead going forward on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault here are some things we learned through the report  no evidence of video at nfl office  in september the associated press reported that a law enforcement official told one of its reporters that the source mailed a copy of a video from a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the now closed revel casino showing rice knocking out palmer to a league executive in april the report said a woman called from a league phone number to acknowledge receipt of the video the report says more than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that happened among the employees questioned were the women whose id badges indicated they were in the nfl office on april 9 all 188 said they made no phone call each denied having seen the inelevator video or even hearing a rumor that an inelevator video of the rice incident had been received by the league before it appeared on celebrity news website tmz on september 8 investigators said also questioned were people in the mailroom and no one there could remember a package sent to jeff miller the leagues senior vice president of security multiple emails from highlevel nfl executives indicate they had not seen the video before it was posted on tmz the report says ray rices attorney had copy of video on april 1  the prosecutors office in atlantic county wanted to wait until after a grand jury heard the case in late march before releasing the video to michael diamondstein rices attorney diamondstein had asked for a copy from the casino on february 20 he was told by the casinos lawyer that police said not to turn over any evidence while an investigation was ongoing later diamondstein was referred to the prosecutor rice was indicted on march 27 on a thirddegree aggravated assault charge his lawyer received a copy of the video from the casino on april 1 and from the prosecutor days later as part of the process of discovery the report says diamondstein chatted about the video with ravens president richard cass and the lawyer said it was terrible the two disagree precisely when the call took place and how much of what was on the video was discussed diamondstein told investigators that if the league had asked for a copy of the video he would have provided it that was one of the leagues missteps identified in the report others included not contacting police officers who investigated the incident not attempting to get videos from the casino or the prosecutors and not following up with the ravens to see if the team had information the league did not had the league undertaken a more substantial investigation it may have gathered available information about the incident possibly including the inelevator video prior to its public release the report says atlantic city police called nfl in march  a private investigator who was working the case for the nfl had been in touch with the atlantic city police department trying to get the arrest report and other documents he was told twice the police wouldnt provide the information he asked a supervisor in the records division ava davenport if he could get reports if he filed an open public records act request she said everything in it would be redacted on march 28 the day after rices indictment someone using davenports work phone called the nfl office and spoke to an operator for 59 seconds police declined to discuss the nature of the call and the operator couldnt remember what was discussed the call wasnt transferred records showed the incident was viewed live  a security officer at the casino watched rice strike palmer twice as it happened on a surveillance monitor that employee called another security officer to the elevator when a supervisor arrived palmer couldnt remember what had happened two dvd copies of surveillance video were given to police that morning the inhouse copy of video was viewable by security workers for several days before access was restricted one employee told muellers team as many as 40 people had access to the room where the video could be watched mueller calls investigation independent  several media reports had called into question mueller as lead investigator because his law firm has done work for the nfl but mueller writes he has never provided legal services to the league nor has any of his team mueller said he joined the wilmerhale firm in march 2014 years after the firm helped the league negotiate with two media groups in the past four years the firm has only provided advice on immigration issues placing these relationships in context i am quite confident that the ties described above have in no way influenced the conduct of this investigation he says recommendations  mueller says our findings demonstrate the weaknesses inherent in the leagues longstanding practice of deferring to the criminal justice system with respect to the investigation of facts and the imposition of discipline under the personal conduct policy discipline should be imposed on the basis of the specific nature of the players conduct not solely or necessarily on the disposition of a criminal case he recommend the nfl establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases that the league expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel and clarify policies that assured teams the league shared information investigations of domestic violence cases present unique challenges the report says,"report says league might have seen inelevator video if it had done better investigation

03574037c48b8016eee986f097c62f7f1eb30ecf,long beach california cnn  the great question that has never been answered and which i have not yet been able to answer despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul is what does a woman want  this was sigmund freuds response in 1925 to a female protégé marie bonaparte who sought his guidance bonaparte then in her early 40s suffered in her own words from frigidity his question is alive today last week a food and drug administration panel reviewed the efficacy  and safety of a new drug to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder  lack of sexual desire the panel did not recommend approval ill come back to this in a minute why does freuds question persist well one reason may have to do with who is asking the question when and why in the early decades of the 20th century for example a manhattan new yorkbased gynecologist named robert l dickinson was preoccupied with what made women unhappy in their marriages so many had complained to him that they didnt enjoy sex this prompted the doctor an early advocate of birth control devices and a passionate promoter of womens sexual pleasure to conduct research  loosely defined  on some of his thousands of female patients he studied their bodies and sketched their contours looking for clues to their sensitivities and habits female genitals were texts for the doctor to read but so were the tales of erotic misery  or just plain indifference  that his patients would tell him the doctor compiled his years of clinical observation in two weighty tomes a thousand marriages 1931 and the single woman 1934 dickinson had a hunch that the growing presence of lesbians in new york and other cities was a symptom of a larger problem with heterosexuality women were turning to each other for sexual relations because men were bad lovers egads maybe the answer to the nagging question could be answered only by women dickinson thereafter proposed to write a book he never published  one that would be addressed to men husbands in particular to teach them how to give pleasure to women waves of research on female sexual response followed throughout the 20th century a time when western society attempted to regulate pleasure by studying it in metric forms and through tortuous interviews and searching questionnaires whats wrong with me became a commonplace and through this complex process lacking desire has become in many ways regarded as just as dangerous as having too much desire  maybe even more so actually here we must turn to money and to the current news of the fda panels hearings last week to decide whether to approve the new pharmaceutical pill flibanserin the drug joins a plethora of pleasureenhancing drugs and devices that in one way or another are premised upon variations of freuds nagging question developed by the german drug company boehringeringelheim the little pink pill little blue viagras sister is meant to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder how by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine libido boosters and decreasing seratonin libido downers in the brains of its sufferers if the drug were approved the new york times reported annual sales might reach 2 billion in the united states alone boehringeringelheim had run a marketing campaign that consisted mainly of convincing women of a certain age and wealth strata that they lack sufficient sexual desire and that they deserve a remedy in a marketdriven society convincing people that they lack something they need is what advertising is all about do i lack sexual desire if you answer yes to this question  and boehringeringelheim reports that 1323 premenopausal women they studied did  you become a member of the target market for flibanserin the companys success or failure in the marketplace rests in large part on women realizing they dont have enough mojo the company limited its subject sample to women living in the us and canada who were otherwise healthy welleducated and mostly married  normal but for their deficiency of desire studied in a doubleblind trial over 24 months women taking the pill reported that sexually satisfying events increased to about 45 a month while those taking a placebo reported about 37 such events incidentally according to the framework of the study these events need not include orgasm q what does a woman want a flibanserin things just got so much easier or did they for starters hypoactive sexual desire disorder rests upon such vague criteria that the american medical association plans to remove it from the next edition of its authoritative diagnostic manual and replace it with desirearousal disorder and even if we grant its existence studies that estimate at least 10 percent of american women suffer from hsdd were paid for by drug companies the new york times says boehringeringelheim offers online medical education courses for health practitioners to get them involved in diagnosing hsdd doctors taking the courses are quizzed on how to diagnose the condition of various kinds of women in one exercise the testtaker is asked to figure out what is wrong with a 42yearold working woman who cares for three children and an ailing mother and lacks sexual desire her husband is a very minor character in the tests scenario dr dickinson may be spinning in his grave now psychologist lenore tiefer who testified before the fda panel friday put it well when she remarked that if the drug had been approved it would have given women the false impression that they can take a pill to get the sex life they read about the one they think everyone else is having one is tempted to ask whether the alleged upward trend in cases of hsdd in women can be correlated to the little blue pills market debut in 1998 with all the talk of erectile dysfunction in men maybe what women want now sexually speaking is a little less pressure to perform through pharmaceutically prolonged sexual encounters and a little more emotional support for their efforts in and out of the bedroom so whats next now that the fda panel said no to flibanserin an online course for male partners to teach them how to make love to women diagnosed with hsdd that would be a start but my guess is that what women want particularly those who have come of age in an era of abstinenceonly education is knowledge about their bodies for themselves and their partners and respect for how their bodies work such knowledge may help themus question whether a daily dose of yet another brain drug will give us what we have come to suspect we need the opinions

049d434dd3d2110060455cc6ef724f2fd2778da4,cnn  syrian president bashar alassad has issued a decree authorising a multiparty political system state media reported thursday a day after the un security council condemned the syrian governments crackdown on protesters the decree issued by assad may have the power to bring to an end decades of singleparty rule by the baath party in syria although it remains unclear how the new law will be implemented the draft law was earlier passed by syrian lawmakers the staterun syrian arab news agency sana reported and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life through peaceful and democratic means however the syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change assads move comes as reports of violence continue to prompt international outrage security forces killed four people after evening prayers on wednesday the londonbased syrian observatory for human rights said one in the southwestern town of nawa in daraa province one in the central city of palmyra and two in damascus the observatory said communications remained cut off thursday in the western city of hama a center of discontent and bastion of antigovernment protest the group is concerned that many civilians may have died as the military remains in the city the un security council on wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the syrian governments crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties the security council condemns the widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the syrian authorities the eightparagraph statement says it calls for all sides to act with utmost restraint and to refrain from reprisals including attacks against state institutions the statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered the security council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of syria it says it stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in syria is through an inclusive and syrianled political process with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population including that of expression and peaceful assembly secretarygeneral ban kimoon who is to update the council on the situation in syria within a week welcomed the statement the world has watched the deteriorating situation in syria with the most profound concern but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking he told reporters once again i call on president bashar al assad and the syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced he urged damascus to comply with the security councils demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas those responsible should be held to account he said he praised the 15nation security council for speaking out with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures after long discussions on the matter but lebanons ambassador caroline ziade said her country which is syrias neighbor dissociated itself from the statement however lebanon chose not to block the measure as it could have done resolutions usually carry with them some sort of action presidential statements are simply unanimous ontherecord positions though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement us diplomats said they were glad the united nations had taken a stance us ambassador susan rice called the statement long overdue she added that she hoped damascus will be chastened by the strength and the unity of the condemnation the statement came on the third consecutive day of talks in new york to address the crisis which a white house spokesman called grotesque

recorded the footage sent to aljazeera  a disturbing video showing the killings of three french soldiers and four people at a jewish school was sent to a tv network  but not by the gunman who filmed it police said the revelation raises the possibility of an accomplice to the crimes arabic tv network aljazeera has said it will not air the footage of the toulouse shootings after the video arrived at its office in paris it appears to have been recorded during mohammed merahs deadly attacks earlier this month the decision not to broadcast the video which was sent on a usb memory stick along with a letter to the station came after french president nicolas sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown police believe it was filmed by the gunman himself who was killed last week after a 32hour standoff with police at his apartment merah recorded all of his murders which began on march 11 with the shooting of a french soldier before the rampage ended two more soldiers three jewish children and a rabbi were killed aljazeeras announcement came as it emerged that merahs convicted criminal father plans to sue the french government for murdering his son in what is likely to be one of the most controversial legal actions in criminal history mohammed benalel merah wants an apology and compensation this is despite the fact that he is a convicted drug dealer who had next to nothing to do with his son from the age of six and now lives in algeria mr merah who is in his 60s said that his son who murdered seven people in total stood no chance against the police meanwhile it has been claimed that the killer had spied for the french secret service before his tenday spree italian  newspaper il foglio alleges that the muslim fanatic acted as an  informer to the dgse intelligence agency while travelling to israel  jordan and afghanistan in 2010 in return for information about islamic terror cells the paper said french agents allowed merah to travel freely il foglio claims details of this arrangement were leaked by french and israeli spies respect president nicolas sarkozy delivers a speech today before magistrates and policemen who investigated the shootings earlier he joined calls for the gunmans footage not to be aired after it was sent to broadcasters  elsewhere  on the continent police in spain arrested a suspected al qaeda member  who is thought to have been key to the terror cells internet  operations spreading propaganda and working to recruit jihadists interior minister jorge fernandez diaz  said the arrest was not connected to the murders in france adding that  the jordanianborn saudi citizen had administered one of the worlds  most important jihadist forums the letter sent to aljazeera said merahs killings were carried out in the name of al qaeda zied tarrouche the networks paris bureau chief said the note was written in poor french with spelling and grammatical errors the  images it accompanied appear to have been taken from the point of view  of the killer he said perhaps from a camera hung around merahs neck they were shaky but of a high technical quality the video had clearly been edited with  religious songs and recitations of koranic verses laid over the  footage mr tarrouche said he added you can hear gunshots at  the moment of the killings you can hear the voice of this person who  has committed these assassinations you can hear also the cries of the  victims and the voices were distorted earlier mr sarkozy had asked that the images not be broadcast i  ask the managers of all television stations that might have these  images not to broadcast them in any circumstances out of respect for  the victims  out of respect for the republic he said family police arrest abdelkader merah the gunmans older brother the killers father has now spoken out in public vowing to sue the french government for shooting his son dead  there has been no indication that other stations received the footage mr tarrouche said we are not a  sensationalist channel were not looking to broadcast images without  weighing the risks and the consequences thats why the management will  decide today after meeting at headquarters in qatar the decision not to broadcast the images came a few hours later as  france tries to come to terms with the attacks shown in the video the  gunmans estranged father says french special forces could easily have  taken my son alive mr merah said they could have used gas to capture him but they preferred to kill him im  going to hire the biggest named lawyers and work for the rest of my  life to pay their costs i will sue france for killing my son siege a hooded policeman looks out of a window at the bulletridden apartment where merah made his last stand the killers father claims police could have taken him alive  his move was immediately condemned by  mr sarkozys government who revealed that mohammed benalel merah spent  four years in prison in toulouse before returning to his homeland of  algeria in 1999 he was arrested for drug  dealing on the toulouse estate where mohammed junior grew up and in  june 2000 he was sentenced to five years in prison the term was  increased by nine months for witness tampering alain  juppe frances foreign secretary said if i was the father of a  monster like that id shut up out of shame while a spokesman for mr  sarkozy said the legal action was abhorrent antiterrorist prosecutor francois molins meanwhile said police did everything they could to arrest merah alive the french authorities activities prior to merahs killings have also come into question security chiefs were today refusing to comment on il foglios claim that they may have been working with the killer before his attacks in southwest france the italian newspaper said merah was considered to fit the profile of the kind of young man who could infiltrate terrorist training camps in afghanistan and pakistan and provide crucial intelligence to western countries prime minister francois fillon last week defended the states intelligence agencies and insisted france had had no grounds to detain merah before he went on his rampage he told french radio there was no single element to allow for the detention of mohammed merah france mourns hundreds of people gather in toulouses capitol square for a minutes silence in memory of merahs victims  intelligence agents had watched him for long enough to come to the conclusion that there was no indication that this was a dangerous man who would one day pass from words to acts merah was interrogated watched and listened to and appeared to be a man living a normal life the selfstyled islamic warrior who was shot dead by police marksmen is said to be buried in algeria so that his grave will not be desecrated in france merahs brother 29yearold abdelkader merah has been charged with aiding and abetting the terrorist both brothers are thought to have been members of radical islamic groups in toulouse and merah was known to security services in both france and america spanish police today arrested a suspected member of al qaeda who was key to the terror groups internet propaganda and recruiting operations officials said the suspect arrested in the eastern city of valencia administered one of the worlds most important jihadist forums dedicated to recruiting and indoctrinating islamic terrorists interior minister jorge fernandez diaz said the name of that forum and the suspects name were not given only his initials mha he is jordanianborn with saudi citizenship he was known within the organisation as al qaedas librarian mr fernandez diaz said without specifying what that term meant in this case the suspect worked at home for 8 to 15 hours a day for al qaeda and for two offshoots al qaeda in the islamic maghreb and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the minister said he spread jihadist ideas and worked to recruit and arrange transportation of possible jihadists to afghanistan and other countries where terrorism is very active mr fernandez diaz said the interior ministry said in a statement he was arrested as part of a probe that determined the man used the web to distribute videos designed to encourage terrorist acts the ministry said in a statement the minister said the raid in which he was arrested was not linked to the recent killings in toulouse france however he added that gunman mohammed merah became indoctrinated thanks to the work of people like the valencia suspect spanish authorities said todays arrest stemmed from a probe that began in february 2011 the suspect was arrested at home on orders from an investigating magistrate in madrid,"arabic broadcaster says it will not air the disturbing footage after plea from nicolas sarkozy

than a year old israa al masri wastes away at the national hospital in the besieged damascus suburbs just a few miles from the medical supplies needed to save her slowly painfully organs shut down one by one as her muscles atrophy until barley breathing on january 12 the toddlers heart stops the cause of death hunger starvation is the syrian governments newest and cruelest weapon against opposition neighborhoods leaving infants with swollen heads and distended bodies their mothers dry of breast milk and their elders skeletal and dehydrated according to activists and doctors in one of the earliest cases 1yearold farah atout arrived at the maliha medical center weak and whimpering as doctors struggled to find veins to feed her intravenously i remember this child very well she was about a year old and she weighed only 4 kilograms said dr mazin ramadan who treated atout last november her destitute family fled their village with just the clothes on their back leaving them with little access to food ramadan said they arrived and put this child between my hands and imagined with a shot or some medicine her strength would come back and the ordeal would be over said ramadan one of the few pediatricians in the area after just 48 hours nothing remained of the baby but a skeletal frame with tubes bandaged to a yellowed face frozen in anguish but what appeared at the time a unique horror now repeats itself over and over in the damascus suburbs doctors and activists told cnn parents often risk death by sniper fire simply to forage for nutrition a nurse who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisal in the besieged yarmouk palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of damascus told amnesty international that around four people a day arrive with gunshot wounds from snipers targeting civilians as they pick plants and shrubs from nearby fields established in 1957 yarmouk an unofficial refugee camp has been home for decades to thousands of palestinians displaced by arabisraeli wars at national hospital south of damascus near yarmouk 43 people have died of starvation 22 of them children the youngest just 23 days old with most of the deaths occurring this past month a dramatic increase according to hospital staff sometimes i get a case due to malnutrition or lack of medicine and i feel utter desperation because i cannot help the child we have reached a state where this is normal  that every two to three days a child dies it just feels like there is no nutrition what can we do said a doctor at the hospital who did not wish to be identified out of fear of syrian forces parents sometimes crumble in the face of despair and very few options i had a 2yearold patient just a few days ago and she was diagnosed with a life threatening condition and when her father found out he said ok i will take her home to die just like that  without hesitation he said what am i to do there is no food and no medicine  the doctor said infants are particularly vulnerable the first 1000 days of life from conception to 2 years are absolutely critical as far as nutrition and the developmental foundations of life are concerned if the child in the womb of a pregnant mother and the mother isnt getting the food she needs and there is this obstacle in the way of getting access to this kind of vital nutrients they need to grow they are not going to recover that is a real tragedy said greg barrow a spokesman for the united nations world food programme in a video widely viewed on youtube of a skeletal 10yearold named bashar kaboush in the eastern ghouta town of jisreen a distraught man who cnn has confirmed is a relative of the child shouts is this acceptable to god look at this child is this acceptable to world does the look like a human body is this the arm of a child he is just 10 years old mohammed abu al rgaa an activist in jisreen told cnn that residents fear kaboush and dozens of others may soon die of hunger rgaa shared with cnn the case of 8monthold mohamad faissal from the same town who recently died from lack of infant milk and proper medical care shocking online video of faissals lifeless body bore the hallmarks of starvation such as a swollen abdomen and protruding ribs doctors said the cause of crisis is clear the once thriving agriculture belt to the east of the capital and the collection of towns and neighborhoods to the south wilted under a government siege blocking food staples from those areas oppositioncontrolled farmland lies desolate after nearly two years of warfare that has destroyed crops and livestock leaving little more than stores of grain for thousands trapped behind government tanks many say the blockades are used by the syrian government as collective punishment against opposition areas hostilities make it difficult to gain a clear view of the scope and scale of malnutrition in the area but the wfp estimates at least 800000 civilians remain under siege this underlines exactly why humanitarian agencies like the wfp have been calling for more access to really see with their eyes what is the scale of the problem who is most vulnerable what kind of assistance do they need and how can we get it in fast that is absolutely critical barrow said amnesty international has been more direct the syrian government is cruelly punishing civilians living in oppositionheld areas starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime the blockades must be lifted immediately and access to humanitarian aid must never be used to score military or political gains said philip luther amnesty internationals middle east and north africa director syrian officials failed to respond to cnn requests for comment on this story but have said in general terms that foreignbacked terrorists catapulted the country into a spiral of violence that has triggered syrian army efforts to expel opposition fighters from the damascus suburbs perhaps most disturbingly packed aid convoys ready and willing to deliver assistance to those in need are barred from doing so  mainly by syrian government troops the road to political stability and confidence building in syria starts with an important step ensuring no one dies because of a lack of food or medicine or from the cold when humanitarian workers are nearby but are not allowed in said ertharin cousin wfps executive director geneva ii peace talks secured an agreement for some aid to enter the yarmouk palestinian refugee camp this week but several hundred food parcels and limited medical evacuations are simply not enough to stave off malnutrition to make any progress in addressing these needs unrwas presence and humanitarian assistance work must be permitted to continue and expand over a period of months not days chris gunness spokesman for the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees said in a statement if the siege does not end i expect even i will be dead assaf said over a crackly skype connection if the siege is not broken these cases will increase and there will be mass death to be honest this is what i would expect mass death,"many are starving in suburbs south of damascus syria

04ef98193d6c50e1f5f22a71b4e3d73f9a1cadae,washington cnn  late last week the leaders and finance ministers of the 20 biggest economies the g20 met in cannes for their annual media extravaganza surprise surprise the g20 summit failed to allay anxieties about greece  and has left the whole world anxious that italy might be the next euro country to plunge into crisis as usual its very hard to see what could possibly be accomplished in an unwieldy format like this taxpayers confronting the enormous cost must wonder how on earth did this event ever come into being anyway a bit of history  thirtyfive years ago a president of france had a very good idea  in the mid1970s the western world faced the first serious economic crisis since world war ii a spike in the price of oil that had sparked record unemployment and unusual inflation cooperation between the big economies was necessary unfortunately the new leaders of the western world did not know each other as well personally as had the great postwar generation of eisenhower degaulle adenauer and so on yes the leaders encountered each other at the un general assembly and other big useless crushes and yes sometimes they scheduled bilateral meetings to discuss particular pieces of business but wouldnt it be nice if the leaders could just regularly sit down for a sequence of informal talk no particular agenda just gettoknowyou hear whats on your mind accordingly president valery giscard destaing proposed a new kind of summit for the leaders of the worlds six largest economies two days at a location outside a capital city to be followed by a bland communique that sent the message if we told you what we discussed at our confidential talks then they would not be confidential talks would they the first meeting was held at rambouillet some 25 miles outside of paris by all accounts the meeting was a great success no the leaders did not overcome their economic challenges but they built new relationships so much so that four leaders in particular remained close friends for the rest of their lives destaing us president gerald ford german chancellor helmut schmidt and british prime minister james callaghan the small summit was recognized as so useful that it quickly evolved into a permanent institution yet almost as soon as the institution was created it began  as international institutions so often do  to bloat from useful innovation into useless behemoth the rambouillet meeting in november 1975 was followed by a meeting in dorado puerto rico in june 1976 at the behest of the united states canada was added to the group which thus became known as the g7 the other six countries by the way were the united states japan west germany britain france and italy the canadian addition was an excellent innovation not so what happened the next year in retaliation for the addition of canada  opposed by france which was then engaged in a grudge match with canada over independence for the frenchspeaking province of quebec  the french demanded and got the addition of the president of the eu commission at the third meeting in london in 1978 as the meetings became a fixture on the annual calendar the agenda for the meetings began to fill the number of aides in attendance grew the press coverage escalated hundreds of journalists converged on the 1988 meeting in toronto with so many tv cameras eager for video political entrepreneurs inevitably materialized to provide the video the cameras needed countersummits political demonstrations and so on three thousand protesters convened in toronto security costs escalated correspondingly to a thenastounding 30 million toronto 1988 was noteworthy as the last of the cold war summits as the world moved into a new political era the g7 summit elephantized in earnest in 1996 the leaders of the un world bank international monetary fund and world trade organization were added in 1997 russia joined the group now renamed the g8  despite the awkward fact that the russian economy had shrunk to approximately the size of that of the netherlands the russian addition raised the question if russia why not china and whats with the whole largest economies thing anyway isnt that kind of  stuckup to respond to that concern a new forum was created in 1999 a meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest economies called you guessed it the g20 during the financial crisis of 2008 the us urged a summit of the heads of government of the g20 what was intended as an emergency summit instantly congealed into a recurring gathering held in the late fall after the g8 meetings of midsummer if the g20 was intended to thwart demands for ever huger expansion of the g8  it failed beginning with the okinawa summit hosted by japan in 2000 five poor countries were added to the g8 guest list south africa was included as a permanent invitee along with four rotating slots for countries like senegal and algeria and if you were already adding poor countries shouldnt we add agencies that address poor country concerns in 2000 the world health organization gained attendance rights too the 2001 meeting in genoa italy was stagemanaged by italys showman prime minister silvio berlusconi he accommodated most of the leaders on luxury cruise ships in genoa harbor to isolate them from the violent protesters on the mainland total costs for the summit were now soaring toward and then past the quarterbillion mark in 2003 china and india were added as temporary members the group was now being called the g85 the g85 format quickly broke down however at the 2004 meeting in sea island georgia the united states invited 13 additional countries plus of course all those international organizations over successive years additional international organizations would be added to the roster the african union unesco the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the league of arab states in 2010 canada hosted the g8 summit of world leaders in the rural setting of huntsville ontario at the same time as the g20 finance ministers met in downtown toronto for the first time costs pass the 1 billion mark mostly due to higher security expenses but this experiment in folding the g8 plus 5 into the g20 failed the two massive entities retained their distinctness each separately growing bigger costlier and progressively more useless at the 2010 g8 meeting france proposed junking the g85 format for a permanent g14 format the core seven plus russia plus china india brazil mexico south africa and 1 muslim country so nobody will feel left out that idea looks likely to be adopted in time for the 2013 meeting in the united kingdom by which point of course the original purpose of the meeting will have been lost under the layers of accreted uselessness so sources close to david cameron are reporting that the young british prime minister has had a brainwave now that the g8 has swelled into a grandiose nightmare mobile un general assembly  now that the g8 is evolving into a group very nearly identical to the g20  why not just junk the g14 or merge it with the un general assembly which would amount to the same thing as junking it then the leaders of britain and other major countries could organize amongst themselves some informal talks no particular agenda just gettoknowyou hear whats on your mind  coming up soon the new g30 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of david frum,"in mid1970s french president proposed informal meeting of leaders from six nations 
in past three decades david frum writes the meeting has grown larger and larger

05a560db514bcf30a8b6deedc4b34a8af90c623c,washington cnn  during his two weeks aboard a ship to the united states ahmed abu khatallah was questioned by fbi interrogators over his alleged role in the 2012 benghazi attacks that left four americans dead as it turns out he was interrogated both before and after authorities told him of his miranda rights  which give him the right to remain silent to avoid selfincrimination a us official told cnn but abu khatallah continued providing information to officials after being advised of those rights the official said the handling of his case has triggered fallout in washington i have serious concerns that conducting a rushed interrogation onboard a ship and then turning abu khatallah over to our civilian courts risks losing critical intelligence that could lead us to other terrorists or prevent future attacks sen kelly ayotte rnew hampshire said in a statement saturday a us official told cnn that abu khatallah denied participation in the benghazi attacks during his interviews with interrogators  but provided information on others he said participated and were behind the attacks it wasnt clear if he provided the information before or after he was advised of his miranda warning shortly after the white house announced the capture earlier this month republicans like florida sen marco rubio criticized the obama administration because they believed the alleged terrorist should go through a military tribunal at guantanamo bay instead of being tried in a federal court if they bring him to the united states theyre going to mirandize this guy and it would be a mistake for the ages to read this guy his miranda rights south carolina sen lindsey graham has said but the white house has defended its decision saying that they have successfully tried a number of terrorists domestically and that no new captives have gone to the guantanamo bay detention facility in years abu khatallah arrived on us soil saturday after two weeks aboard the uss new york sailing from the mediterranean sea to the east coast abu khatallah was flown by helicopter to washington and was driven to a federal courthouse there he pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists prosecutors say he is the ringleader of the 2012 attacks on a us diplomatic mission in libya which killed us ambassador to libya chris stevens and three other americans more charges possible  the single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors who plan to file additional charges later according to us officials the aim is to delay releasing to the public and abu khatallahs lawyer the fbi affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him an earlier criminal complaint in july 2013 said the fbi believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the benghazi attacks those additional charges if formally added could bring the death penalty in his court appearance abu khatallah a libyan national requested consular assistance from the libyan government us authorities were working with libyan embassy officials in washington to provide him the assistance after the hearing armed guards accompanied abu khatallah from the federal courthouse in downtown washington a few blocks from the us capitol and near the white house he was then moved to the detention center in alexandria virginia which is across the potomac river from the capital details of the attacks  authorities say abu khatallah is among the senior leaders of ansar al sharia whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on us government facilities in benghazi on september 1112 2012 the attacks spawned political controversy in the united states because some republican lawmakers claim the obama administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them the gop critics say they plan to make benghazi an issue for former secretary of state hillary clinton under whose watch the attacks occurred should she decide to run for president the criminal investigation led by the fbi has been extraordinarily challenging authorities say partly because the lack of libyan government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks but us officials say they collected surveillance video phone recordings and witness statements to bring charges against abu khatallah and others involved abu khatallah became the face of the militant attack and a top target for the us after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks meeting with journalists and granting interviews he denied to cnns arwa damon that he participated in the attacks us military commandos captured abu khatallah in a nighttime raid june 1516 us intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the americans surprised him the commandos accompanied by several fbi agents had come ashore by boat and quickly took him back out to sea with them abu khatallah was appointed a public defender michele peterson he was ordered to remain in custody until hearings set for

07099e81e7d8fa45f75c62d3eb8ea039d0248d4d,greensboro north carolina cnn  the wife of a former top aide to former presidential candidate john edwards defended in testimony tuesday having shot video in september 2008 of the house and possessions of edwards pregnant mistress i wanted proof that i really was taking care of rielle hunter said cheri young whose husband andrew was a top aide to the thencandidate for the democratic presidential nomination who is now facing federal corruption charges defense attorney alan duncan showed the jury the videotape of the north carolina house leased by hunter who was in california and had not given her consent to the taping a number of personal pictures hunters california drivers license and a tentative list of baby names were shown to the camera young said she had not asked hunter for permission because she assumed hunter was out of the country on a trip planned by edwards benefactor fred baron i wasnt looking through ms hunters private things young said asked why she was videotaping hunters private items young responded things had gone sour between the youngs and edwards and young wanted to be able to show that the money given to herself and her husband had in fact been spent on hunter for such items as a lease on a house and furniture earlier in the day young had defended her husbands motivations for writing a tellall book about him the only reason for my husband to write a book is because mr edwards did not come forward and tell the truth she testified she was responding to questions from duncan about profits from the book young pointed to an interview with abc news in august 2008 during which edwards did not acknowledge having fathered a child by hunter as a critical moment in the decision to write the politician an insiders account of john edwardss pursuit of the presidency and the scandal that brought him down it was discussed as a way to completely tell the truth in 2008 she said i wanted the truth to come out the defense pointed out that cheri and andrew young stand to make more money if the book is used as the basis for a movie about the disgraced politician would you like to get additional income from the movie being made the defense lawyer asked to that cheri young offered no apologies yeah ill take income she said but she maintained that the only reason she was still involved in the story was because of the court case i came here because i had to come here she said the defense also said young has little firsthand knowledge of the events ie that most of what she knew she learned secondhand from her husband not from primary sources young testified that she had not been in the same room with her husband when he made many of the calls that have been cited in the case the defense also tried to assert that andrew young was drinking heavily in 2006 and 2007 that it affected his memory and that he was mixing alcohol and ambien the prescription medication is used in the treatment of insomnia its combination with alcohol can increase the chance that a person taking the medication will experience side effects according to the package insert the defense added that andrew youngs work for edwards was a source of tension in their marriage which caused cheri young to resent her husband she denied the claim cheri young had testified monday that edwards told her that using money from one of his benefactors to pay his mistresss expenses was legal get the money in said edwards who was then running for president cheri young recalled monday prosecutors say those donations which werent reported to federal authorities were illegal and represent a chief reason edwards is being tried on six felony counts also charged with conspiracy and making false statements he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted on all counts young testified monday that she felt disgusted after being asked to endorse and deposit checks from 101yearold heiress rachel bunny mellon intended to pay hunters expenses edwards who was then married eventually admitted having carried on an affair with hunter whom his campaign had hired as a videographer and fathering her child cheri young sobbed on the stand monday after explaining her reaction to being told that edwards wanted her husband to claim that he was the father of hunters child the first thing in my mind was how in the world mr edwards could ask one more thing of us young said of her thoughts at the time despite her reservations young said she participated in a december 2007 conference call with her husband edwards and the thenpregnant hunter mr edwards was trying to get everyone on board young testified he talked over and over about the campaign she said edwards also said that he didnt want his wife elizabeth who had been diagnosed with cancer to find out about the affair and child elizabeth edwards died of breast cancer in december 2010 andrew young did once claim to be the father of hunters child though edwards  after losing his bid for the democratic nomination  acknowledged that the child was in fact his he is accused of concealing 725000 in contributions from mellon and more than 200000 from texas lawyer baron who has since died from the public and from the federal election commission by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports edwards attorneys have argued that andrew young was involved in a ruse to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors for his personal use the former aide admitted during questioning by edwards attorney that he used campaign donations for his own benefit including to fund construction of a home that included a pool and a theater cnns ted metzger eric fiegel oliver janney and scott garber contributed to this report,"new things had gone sour

04ce03d1bb2fe42e3e80419c735675cc8c2f6fcf,by  daily mail reporter  a newlyreleased report has revealed that two of governor chris christies aides were romantically involved leading up to last years traffic closures bridget anne kelly who infamously sent an email saying time for some traffic problems in fort lee was reportedly dating christies former campaign manager bill stepien throughout much of his reelection race the report released today by a law firm christie hired to investigate the scandal said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the george washington bridge lane closures under examination bridget anne kelly the christie aide who sent the infamous time for some traffic problems in fort lee email was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal  close bill stepien left was christies campaign manager until april when he stepped down and kelly took over and it appears that is when their romantic relationship took off  stepien 36 worked as the republican governors deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in april to become christies campaign manager he was replaced by kelly 41 at  some point after stepiens departure to run the campaign kelly and  stepien became personally involved although by early august 2013  their personal relationship had cooled apparently at stepiens choice  and they largely stopped speaking the report by randy mastro states because stepien was her benefactor kelly relied heavily on him during this transition ahead of their august break up the  report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to  create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution  scheme the taxpayerfunded  report released by mastro a former federal prosecutor relies on  interviews with christie and other officials in his administration and  250000 documents many of them emails and text messages chris christies government funded lawyer claims the new jersey governor had nothing to do with the george washington bridge scandal  we  found that governor christie had no knowledge beforehand of this george  washington bridge realignment idea mastro said at a news conference his report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers some of the key figures would not cooperate with mastros investigation leading democrats to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness assembly select committee on investigation cochair john wisniewski released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by christie to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal lawyers hired by and paid by the christie administration itself to investigate the governors office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter he said in a statement during a media conference call thursday wisniewski said that the mention of kelly and stepiens romantic entanglements was irrelevant especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures it is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you dont hear from both sides he said it reads more like a novel than a work of fact defending the report at a news conference thursday mastro said we believe we have gotten to the truth or we wouldnt be reporting it the september closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of fort lee have become a major scandal for christie a possible 2016 republican presidential contender christie said on a radio show wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future in his view governor christies office hired randy mastro a former federal prosecutor to investigate the scandal and the report released thursday declares clears christie of wrongdoing  the lawyer hired by new jersey gov chris christie to review a trafficblocking scandal that has engulfed christies administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot  the report issued at mastros new york law office concludes that former port authority of new york and new jersey official david wildstein and exchristie aide bridget kelly were behind the closures and that they were targeting fort lee mayor mark sokolich but it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the democrat and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse christie for reelection last year mastro says that kelly who did not cooperate with the report tried to cover her tracks when christie began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway the report says mastro also says that wildstein suggested he mentioned traffic issues in fort lee to christie at public event during the lane realignment wildstein says christie did not recall it being brought up and if it was it would not have registered as significant to christie  something christie has said before the report also finds that a claim by hoboken mayor dawn zimmer that christies administration told her that superstorm sandy would be tied to a private redevelopment plan is demonstrably false a spokesman for zimmer did not immediately return a call mastro calls for christies office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business eliminating the office where kelly had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governors office he also recommends major changes to the structure of port authority an agency jointly run by the states of new york and new jersey,"report reveals that top christie aides bridget anne kelly and bill stepien were romantically involved from april to august of last year

05ab167af965de7bda43f65c7a8c5d31e21a4887,he spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding for obamacare then republican sen ted cruz of texas joined the other 99 senators from both parties in voting wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expected to do just that the rare 1000 vote on a procedural step means the spending measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown next week now can be amended by senate democrats to restore funding for president barack obamas signature health care reforms which had been eliminated last week by house republicans cruz led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block senate consideration of the spending legislation because democratic majority leader harry reid made clear his caucus would remove the provision that defunded obamacare however cruz came under strong criticism from fellow republicans for that strategy which called for gop senators to filibuster the house measure that  in its original form  would defund programs under the affordable care act passed in 2010 and upheld by the supreme court last year fed up over beltway shutdown battle  the confusion of cruzs strategy was apparent wednesday when he voted with democrats for the senate to take up the measure less than two hours after his marathon speech against it that began tuesday afternoon and continued overnight and through the morning an aide to cruz told cnn chief congressional correspondent dana bash that the senator always intended to allow formal consideration of the house measure adding that cruz would vote against it once senate democrats restored the obamacare funding however nothing in cruzs words or actions preceding the vote indicated that was his intention instead he had urged his colleagues to unite against the spending plan saying voting for it was tantamount to supporting obamacare any senator who votes to move forward with debate on the house measure is voting to give harry reid the authority to fund obamacare cruz told bash on monday after wednesdays vote cruz told reporters that his long night sought to unite republicans to block any funding for obamacare coming into this debate we clearly were not united he said there were significant divisions in the conference i hope those divisions dissolve that we come together in party unity with all 46 republicans preventing a final vote on the spending plan once democrats amend it to fund obamacare cruz and other tea party conservatives wanted to prevent the senate from taking up the spending measure passed last week by the gopcontrolled house that makes continued government funding contingent on denying any money for obamacare how this affects you  while his drawnout floor speech did not constitute a filibuster it was intended to rally opposition to the state goal of senate democrats to restore the obamacare funding however cruz lacked support for his tactics from senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky and other influential veterans including sens john mccain of arizona and bob corker of tennessee in the end cruz voted with them to open the spending plan to revisions by the democraticled chamber reid called cruzs allnight speech a waste of time as the nation faced a possible partial shutdown of the government if congress fails to authorize government spending beyond monday when the current fiscal year ends to reid the tactic reflected a perspective that a bad day for government amounted to a good day for tea party conservatives earlier wednesday corker told cnn that a better idea would be to get the bill back to the house as soon as possible so the republican majority there can offer a compromise house members are already talking about how they might respond if the defunding component ends up being stripped out corker said adding he hoped that the senate would give the house some time to respond in a thoughtful way with obamacare markets for the uninsured set to open on october 1 which also begins the new fiscal year gop opponents consider this their last best chance to undermine or amend the health care reforms a possible gop counterproposal floated by corker would delay its full implementation for a year he noted that obama already postponed another component affecting business implementation of health care reforms for a year under the process planned by reid a final senate vote on the revised spending plan would occur over the weekend to leave the house a day at most to reconsider it however reid said wednesday he wanted the senate to complete its work on the measure as soon as possible cruz as he approached the conclusion of his overnight speech thanked the senate staff and others who have endured this bataan death march when he began at 240 pm tuesday cruz said he intended to speak in support of defunding obamacare until i am no longer able to stand he filled the ensuing hours with a blend of political rhetoric and emotional pleas for republicans like corker to unite in opposition to obamacare  darth vader sean connery chinese gooseberries and other highlights  conservative colleagues including sen mike lee of utah marco rubio of florida david vitter of louisiana and james inhofe of oklahoma joined him at times to assume the main talking duties and allow cruz to rest his vocal chords green eggs and ham gets a reading  on tuesday night he read the dr seuss childrens classic green eggs and ham to his daughters as he reached 18 hours of holding the senate floor on wednesday morning cruz compared his antiobamacare effort to the star wars films referring to having heard someone use the phrase rebellion against oppression cruz said those words conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire the empire being the washington dc establishment and indeed immediately on hearing that phrase i wondered if at some point we would see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice mike lee i am your father  cruz said his effort is a fight to restore freedom to the people this is a fight to get the washington establishment the empire  to listen to the people and just like in the star wars movies the empire will strike back but at the end of the day i think the rebel alliance i think the people will prevail later he called for senate republicans to show the same courage as their party colleagues in the house in making a stand to defund obamacare he alluded to the risks faced by the signers of the declaration of independence noting they were mostly wealthy landowners who faced hanging for treason for their actions whats ted cruzs deal at 9 am wednesday cruz was alone on the floor except for the presiding officer democratic sen dick durbin durbin and cruz engaged in some hostile exchanges with the illinois democrat accusing cruz of trying to deny health care coverage for tens of millions of currently uninsured americans while enjoying the benefits of a federal health care program cruz responded that obamacare was flawed and hurting the country and the focus should be on a better solution instead of continuing on with a failed system what you need to know about the possible shutdown  two sides battle it out on social media  earlier cruz sought to define his battle as purely about principle saying this fight is not about any member of this body this fight is not about personalities look most americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in washington he said who cares almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts who cares supporters cheered him on through social media and standwithcruz became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter but supporters of the health care law made themselves heard as well on wednesday morning the two sides were battling it out in the top trending topic in the united states obamacare 5 strange things about debt ceiling politics  key republicans critical of cruz strategy  cruz also has been the target of criticism by some top republicans gop infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding obamacare escalated tuesday as mcconnell publicly dismissed cruzs more confrontational strategy cruzs gop critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal arguing there is no way to stop obamacare as long as democrats maintain control of the senate and obama is in the white house they believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown  or preventing an increase in the debt ceiling next month  will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the republican brand what happens in a government shutdown  the treasury department said wednesday that the debt ceiling  which is the amount the federal government can borrow to pay its bills  must be raised by october 17 to prevent a possible default house republicans say they will propose a package of measures that includes a oneyear delay in full implementation of obamacare to a proposal to extend the debt limit for a year house republican leaders met wednesday evening to discuss the policy priorities they plan to attach but there are signs leadership is running into resistance from conservatives some of whom do not want additional borrowing others want to add new items while others still question the strategy of taking up the debt bill in the middle of fight over spending and a possible government shutdown the white house rejects negotiations on the debt issue saying something as fundamental as ensuring the good credit of the united states must be above politics the last debt ceiling fight in congress in 2011 caused the firstever downgrade of the us credit rating and obama and top democrats warn playing politics with the issue now will cause economic harm amid the still fragile recovery can it be stopped,"cruz marathon floor speech was to rally gop unity against obamacare

on from the dugout during the match at ibrox  ricksen centre is carried by ronald de boer left and thomas buffel right  i dont want to feel too much sympathy i am not pitiful please dont treat me that way it will be tough but ill keep my head up it was a shock when i got the diagnosis especially after i had googled what the illness exactly means all of a sudden you know you may be dead within a year i still hope the doctors have made a mistake that one day they will say it isnt mnd as long as i dont have the really heavy symptoms of mnd its a straw i keep grasping at i know it sounds strange but being chased by the grim reaper doesnt affect your life that much not when your motto is dont look back we avoid pessimism and depression by not talking and thinking too much about the disease thats one of the reasons why we dont shoot an enormous amount of footage of our life as it is today for my daughter isabella that would put too much emphasis on the illness ibrox was packed full of supporters offering tributes to former player ricksen  the money raised from yesterdays match will be split four ways with ricksen and young isabella each receiving a share and the remainder going to mnd scotland and the rangers charity foundation among those to have contributed include old foes celtic  with a 10000 donation  a fact that didnt greatly surprise the man himself as he revealed it isnt true that all celtic supporters have always hated me when i was playing for zenit lots of scottish tourists wanted to have their picture taken with me on the red square  even celtic fans that was very rewarding so i must have done something good ricksen had been back to ibrox in a playing role since his departure for rangers turning out for zenit in a friendly but yesterday was different in a very familiar way the crazy traffic the huge queues that saw kickoff delayed by half an hour it was like a throwback to more successful times in govan former rangers winger neil mccann noted its great to see such a big crowd at ibrox again i gave fernando a hug and said this feels like the old times fans held banners scarfs and signs and chanted ricksens name during the tribute  the former old firm warrior was accompanied by isabella as he made his way between a guard of honour formed by both teams before kickoff the atmosphere creeping closer to spinetingling levels as he slowly marched out with his ability to speak severely damaged by the disease the look of joy on ricksens face said as much as words ever could the game itself was of course an afterthought a 74 romp for the all stars gordon durie peter lovenkrands thomas buffel and nacho novo scored for the home team while james beattie was among the many visitors to find the net  the first time this particular former rangers player had ever scored at ibrox there was only one choice for man of the match though ricksen lauded again as his name was announced then receiving a further standing ovation as he came back on the pitch for a lap of honour he was carried aloft on the shoulders his teammates borne ever higher by the goodwill of all in attendance ricksen centre lifts the scottish premier league trophy as a player for the club in 2005  and the last word went to the man himself in a way too when his close friend roy knez read out a statement on his behalf declaring fellow blue noses thank you for your support today the numbers who turned out make me feel so happy it gives me a fighting spirit when i played here i gave everything for the worlds most successful club now the club and the fans have given me so much more back i need it now ive never been so proud to be a rangers man thank you i love you rangers forever,"former rangers captain fernando ricksen has motorneurone disease

05928caecec6a5566507bd9249913425b8008b2c,coalinga california cnn  a california state panel on wednesday denied parole for sirhan b sirhan saying the convicted assassin of robert f kennedy hasnt demonstrated an understanding of the magnitude of his crimes commissioner mike prizmich of the california board of parole hearings told sirhan that he failed to meet the states criteria for suitability for parole and added that he failed to seek selfhelp program and his behavoir was immature in response sirhan sought to interrupt prizmich who admonished the inmate prizmich however said sirhan would be eligible for parole again in five years at this hearing youre interrupting me time and time again demonstrating a lack of control and impulsitivity prizmich told sirhan sirhan made his first appearance before a california parole board since 2000 supported by two psychologists reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society his attorney said while sirhan sirhans statements at his parole hearing will likely be the source of continuing public interest due to the infamous nature of the crime there is little he can say that is likely to sway the parole board and convince them that he deserves to be released from prison said robert mintz a former federal prosecutor weisel who shared with cnn his prepared statement to the parole board said he was hit by a stray bullet in the abdomen on that terrible evening a quarter past midnight on june 5 1968 after kennedy had just won the california primary in his bid for the democratic presidential nomination now 73 weisel of healdsburg california was an abc news associate director at the time of the shooting im advised that two reputable psychologists one representing the state of california and the other from harvard university have concluded after examining him  sirhan sirhan  that if he is granted parole he would not be a threat to himself and others and the community at large if this is a fact and the board is inclined to grant him parole after him being in prison for nearly 43 years i would not be opposed to the decision weisel said in a telephone interview with cnn dahle declined to comment on weisels statement or on the psychologists reports to the parole board but he said weisels scheduled appearance would mark the first time during sirhans imprisonment that a surviving witness voiced no objection to his possible parole  at least since 1970 prior to 1970 theres no record of the proceedings and i dont know if anyone showed up dahle said its fairly unusual its not common dahle added with respect to victims attending a parole hearing and not objecting to the prisoner being released we dont get many at least in cases in los angeles county  where we get victims or victims next of kin coming to cases its an expensive proposition wednesday will mark sirhans 14th parole hearing its scheduled to be held in the pleasant valley state prison in coalinga california which is 200 miles northwest of downtown los angeles members of the kennedy family and their representatives didnt return messages or emails seeking a comment sirhans attorney william pepper an international human rights attorney and a barrister with offices in new york and london said he and sirhan were very grateful for weisels statement sirhan was convicted of killing kennedy and wounding five other people in the shooting in the kitchen pantry of the ambassador hotel in los angeles the hotel was later razed and a public school now occupies the site he was convicted of firstdegree murder and five counts of assault with attempt to commit murder four of those five surviving victims are alive including weisel the others are paul schrade a kennedy family friend and former uaw union regional leader ira goldstein a former radio journalist and elizabeth y evans a friend of the late pierre salinger a palestinian christian who was born in jerusalem and whose parents brought him and his siblings to america in the 1950s sirhan killed kennedy because of statements the new york senator made about the united states sending fighter jets to aid israel prosecutors argued during sirhans 1969 trial in 1968 senator kennedy who was a younger brother of assassinated president john f kennedy is whose administration he also served as attorney general was a leading contender for the democratic presidential nomination against vice president hubert humphrey and sen eugene mccarthy kennedy was shot only minutes after a hotel ballroom speech televised live to american household in which he claimed victory over mccarthy in the california primary the shooting in the hotels kitchen pantry was not captured by any cameras sirhan was the only person arrested in the shooting sirhan has jordanian citizenship but never became a us citizen so if the parole board were to release him he would be deemed an illegal immigrant and deported to jordan where he has extended family his attorney said sirhans younger brother munir 63 continues to live in the southern california community where the sirhan family siblings were raised munir sirhan said sirhan sirhan has maintained a good relationship with his brother and he would love to live with this brother in pasadena but thats very unlikely because of his immigration status pepper said daniel brown an associate clinical professor in psychology at harvard medical school has submitted a statement to the parole board after interviewing sirhan for 60 hours over a threeyear period pepper said the report is part of a sealed file but i can say that sirhan does not have any violent tendency that should be regarded as a threat to the community pepper said browns report confirms sirhans legitimacy of the loss of his memory including in the pantry during the shooting and in moments of his life in the year prior to the kennedy slaying pepper said sirhan has at various times taken responsibility for the robert kennedy assassination but the actual fact is that he doesnt remember what happened in the pantry at all but because everyone around there told him he did it and he had a pistol and he did fire that pistol he came to believe that he was actually guilty pepper said sirhan shows no sign of mental illness and has demonstrated remorse for the shootings pepper said sirhan has been free of any disciplinary rulings against him in prison pepper said hes said no day of his life goes by where he doesnt have remorse and deep regret that this took place and the role he played in this thing pepper said hes not schizophrenic or psychotic and he has not shown any history of violence during incarceration pepper said he became sirhans pro bono attorney in the fall of 2007 after he learned of the results of an audio analysis conducted on a sound track of the kennedy shooting the audio recording made 40 feet away from the crime scene by freelance newspaper reporter stanislaw pruszynski is the only known recording of the gunshots in that june 1968 assassination pepper said he believes the pruszynski recording is evidence showing that there was a second gun firing in addition to sirhans iverjohnson handgun the tape was uncovered in 2004 by cnns brad johnson who had the recording independently examined by two audio analysts spence whitehead in atlanta georgia and philip van praag in tucson arizona johnson reported on their separate findings for cnns backstory in june 2009 but the parole board wont hear arguments on the secondgun evidence pepper said rather the parole panel will focus on sirhans suitability for parole he said the pruszynski recording clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry and sirhans gun had only eight shots so it definitely means there was a second shooter pepper said but weisel joined by authorities who have dismissed the secondgun assertion said he was convinced that sirhan was a lone gunman ive seen so many theories after 43 years please  i think you can have a conspiracy in a dictatorship and some countries but i dont think so in a democracy or our country where there is freedom of speech weisel said however another shooting victim sees it differently than weisel schrade he is a kennedy friend who was shot in the forehead while standing immediately behind robert kennedy in the pantry in 2008 schrade now 86 told cnn that he believes evidence clearly shows sirhan was not the only person who fired shots in that assassination we have proof that the second shooter was behind us and off to our right sirhan was off to the left and in front of us schrade told cnn anchor adrian finighan schrade declined to comment to cnn this week about wednesdays scheduled parole hearing for sirhan in a 2006 interview on cnns larry king live weisel recounted how kennedy and he were shot well i was right behind bobby we were following him to go downstairs and speak to another group of people and i was going with our cameraman down to show him where to plug in and so we followed bobby and the shooting started weisel said he said after kennedy was struck three times he was shot once in the stomach dahle the deputy district attorney said sirhan wasnt present at his last two parole hearings in 2003 and 2006 which dahle attended pepper said he was chairman of kennedys citizens campaign in westchester county new york during his successful 1964 bid for the us senate and peppers duties included taking kennedys sisters and mother to political events he said he was also a volunteer in the successful 1960 presidential campaign of kennedys brother john kennedy in 1999 pepper represented the rev dr martin luther kings family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning kings april 4 1968 murder and successfully persuaded a memphis tennessee jury to find lloyd jowers responsible as an accomplice in the king assassination if sirhan is denied parole pepper said he would consider appealing the matter to the courts sirhan was initially sentenced to death but three years later that sentence was commuted by california courts to life imprisonment plus six months to 14 years in prison to run concurrently,"sirhan sirhan will not be eligible for parole again for five years

killing of nightclub doorman bahman  faraji 44 however he was convicted of two counts of perverting the course of justice by lying to police in the early stages of the murder investigation and disposing of a pair of gloves he wore on the night jailed former brookside actor brian regan left was cleared of murdering a nightclub doorman but was jailed for perverting the course of justice he is pictured right as his brookside character terry sullivan  regan who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place was jailed on january 25 for a total of four years and 10 months the facts can now be revealed after mrs justice nicola davies lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant jason gabbana who was today convicted of the murder bahman faraji known by the nicknames batman and ben was gunned down in a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution prosecutors said it was the result of an argument between criminals those involved in the shooting went to extraordinary lengths to lure mr faraji 44 to his death on february 24 last year he had gone to the belgrave public house that night following a series of phone calls he received from a payasyougo mobile phone victim nightclub doorman bahman faraji was shot in the face  this was a dirty phone obtained for the purpose of luring mr faraji to his death and used in a disciplined way that was designed to leave no clue as to the identity of its user prosecutor brian cummings qc had told the jury regans unwitting involvement began when he delivered a 30 bag of cocaine to drug user edward heffey the former soap star told the trial he would supply heffey a convicted armed robber with drugs about three or four times a day that night heffey asked for a lift to go and get money so he could pay for the drugs regan said the pair then drove to belgrave road around the corner from the pub and heffey left the vehicle as regan snorted a line of cocaine mr faraji arrived at the belgrave in the company of two other men shortly after 630pm on the night of his murder they spent about 10 minutes in the pub before they went outside and stood on the pavement a short while later the gunman approached and said to mr faraji are you ben mr faraji nodded and the killer raised his shotgun and fired it directly into the victims face from a distance of three or four feet mr faraji fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke and died instantly as heffey ran back to the waiting car detective chief inspector neil bickley of merseyside polices major incident team said it was a shocking crime he added any murder is an appalling event but to me this was striking  it was 650pm in a quiet residential area outside a pub during halftime in a liverpool match what became apparent during the investigation and from the evidence in the trial is that mr faraji had received a telephone call in the evening requesting him to go to the pub for a meeting that call was from a dirty phone which was used to deliberately lure him to the pub to be shot mr bickley added the defendants have never volunteered any information to suggest what the motive was actor brian regan can be seen performing in a play called 30 days in walton jail back in 2008  brutal the murder occurred outside the belgrave pub in aigburth liverpool pictured which is in a quiet residential area  it would seem likely to me that mr faraji thought he was going to meet somebody he knew its entirely possible that was for some sort of illicit meeting but we really dont know at this stage following the shooting detectives launched a murder investigation and began by hunting for the getaway car a red ford escort estate which had been spotted by witnesses and on cctv the next day police stopchecked the vehicle in liverpool city centre and at the wheel was regan alongside girlfriend christine line regan initially told police he had not been anywhere near the area where the murder took place but lines witness statement contained significant differences and detectives became suspicious caught brian regan drove edward heffey left to the pub on the night of the murder jason gabbana right has been convicted of the murder  the couple were arrested that night and regans efforts to distance himself from the shooting quickly unravelled mr bickley said the last thing the police need at the start of an investigation is somebody trying to wrong foot them thats clearly what regans statements were intended to do fortunately we were not wrong footed for too long but it is completely unacceptable to mislead the police at any time and certainly at the start of a murder investigation when time is so critical for us the jury was told that on the way to the police station regan said i done nothing wrong and i didnt do anything willingly he also told detectives i want to help you but ill be shot after giving evidence against his coaccused the court ordered security be stepped up around regan and that security guards sit between him and the rest of the defendants he was also designated a vulnerable prisoner and placed in the isolation wing of his jail popular tv show brookside  which brian regan starred in  was set in this residential close in liverpool  prisoner regan was found not guilty at liverpool crown court pictured over his role in the killing of faraji but he was jailed for perverting the course of justice  mr bickley said the murder had left a devastating mark on mr farajis family there is a sixyearold son who is going to grow up without knowing his dad and that is appalling the detective added it is going to take an awful long time for them to come to terms with whats happened paul whittaker the chief crown prosecutor for merseyside said this was a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution of a 44yearold man in a quiet residential street in a suburban part of liverpool the whole circumstances of the offence are quite shocking the

opened fire thats because marines used infrared and bodyheat scanners to pinpoint the locations of everyone inside the condo and make sure they were asleep a mexican official told cnn saturdays predawn operation that captured guzman in the mexican pacific resort town of mazatlan marked a dramatic twist in a case that has long captivated the country and frustrated investigators on both sides of the usmexico border the notorious sinaloa cartel leaders nickname which means shorty belies the tall and nearmythic status guzman achieved in recent years for his ability to elude capture by using bribes safe houses and an army of cartel helpers his 13 years on the lam ended saturday inside a nofrills condo tower where investigators found guzman lying shirtless next to his beautyqueen wife the mexican official who asked not to be identified because hes not authorized to speak publicly about the case said that guzmans body guard and the drug lords 2yearold twin daughters were also sleeping in the condo he had an ak47 next to the bed when the mexican marines entered the condominium he was still asleep said michael vigil a former drug enforcement administration official who says he was briefed on the raid they used the element of surprise and he did not have a chance to react and seize his weapon escape through sewer tunnels  guzman had an assault rifle and ammunition close by when mexican marines broke into the apartment in a surgical operation the mexican official said authorities had been closing in on guzman for months before mexican marines swooped in mexican attorney general jesus murillo karam told reporters earlier police operations yielded a trove of intelligence including cell phone and other data a us law enforcement official said that helped mexican authorities and us drug enforcement administration agents hunting guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him before guzmans capture mexican federal forces made several significant arrests of sinaloa cartel associates including two people authorities said were suspected of providing security for top leaders of the cartel a key discovery earlier this month marked a turning point in the investigation seven houses in the mexican city of culiacan connected by secret tunnels that also tied in with the citys sewage system mario hidalgo arguello a courier who flipped during questioning by mexican authorities told interrogators about the series of safe houses according to us officials familiar with the hunt for guzman when authorities raided one of them last week it turned out to be guzmans main residence in the town of culiacan the time it took mexican marines to get past the houses reinforced steel doors was enough to allow guzman to escape via a hidden hatch under a bathtub the officials said but the investigation was so thorough that we continued murillo said with authorities temporarily off his trail guzman slipped out of culiacan through the sewer tunnels the mexican official told cnn eventually he made his way to mazatlan a beach resort city about 125 miles 200 km away informants and wiretaps  months before authorities nabbed him there us authorities made a major break in the case in november they arrested serafin zambadaortiz at the nogales arizona border crossing he is the son of guzmans closest lieutenant ismael el mayo zambada likely the sinaloa chiefs heir apparent the arrests intensified in recent months with each providing phones that led to a trove of new data that helped map associates in evercloser touch with guzman us officials familiar with the hunt said agents from the dea immigration and customs enforcement and the us marshals service have fed intelligence gleaned from wiretaps and informants to mexican authorities for years each cell phone led to dozens of others over time it went from phone to phone just basic law enforcement one of the us officials said in recent months investigators focused on five wiretaps  four operated by the dea and one by ice which yielded valuable intelligence the officials said as the hunt intensified guzman and his lieutenants stopped using certain phones apparently aware of the surveillance in the final days the ice wiretap was the only one still producing activity the officials said captured alongside guzman was carlos manuel hooramirez who us authorities say appeared to serve as el chapos communications conduit he carried multiple phones that proved crucial to finding the drug boss the officials said hunt marked by rumors close calls  ever since his escape in a laundry cart from mexicos puente grande prison in 2001 the hunt for guzman has grabbed headlines during the drug lords nearly 13 years on the lam rumors swirled about his whereabouts from time to time investigators suggested they were hot on his trail but even as mexico stepped up its pressure on cartels he remained an elusive target many in the country suggested that his whereabouts were an open secret  and that the government must have been deliberately steering clear of capturing him in 2009 the archbishop of mexicos durango state told reporters that guzman lived near the mountain town of guanacevi everyone knows it except the authorities he said days later investigators found the bodies of two slain army lieutenants in durangos mountains accompanied by a note neither the government nor priests can handle el chapo a year later when asked by reporters again about guzmans whereabouts the archbishop said he is omnipresent  he is everywhere in 2012 a mexican official told the associated press that authorities nearly caught guzman in a raid on a beach mansion in cabo san lucas mexico barely a day after hillary clinton had met with other foreign ministers from across the hemisphere in the same resort town last year guatemalan authorities said a man who resembled guzman died in peten guatemala during a shootout later they changed their story and said guzman wasnt killed and the shootout may never even have happened family still in spotlight  while guzman managed to avoid authorities attention the wrath of his rivals and the medias glare other members of his family werent so lucky authorities arrested guzmans brother known as el pollo the chicken in mexico city in september 2001 three years later he was shot to death by a fellow inmate in a

044f439de3f1d103d4341859349737b89607c344,the archbishop of canterbury has criticised energy companies for imposing huge price rises that will hammer struggling families justin welby said power giants had a massive moral duty beyond squeezing customers for maximum profit and challenged the firms to justify their huge increases in bills the archbishop himself a former oil executive said he understood the anger over apparently inexplicable rises and called on the companies to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity sympathy archbishop of canterbury justin welby said he understood anger over inexplicable rises  he hit out after british gas announced a 92 per cent hike despite parent company centrica recording a 27 billion profit last year other suppliers are expected to follow suit speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday britains most senior cleric said that rises which would add an average 123 a year to bills were a huge moral issue for energy firms archbishop welbys comments will heap pressure on the government to get tougher on the industry energy prices have become a major political issue with labour accusing the government of failing to tackle  ripoff companies while ministers have said consumers should switch to better deals and even wear jumpers to keep warm the archbishop called on energy companies to be conscious of their social obligations and said the impact on people particularly on low incomes is going to be really severe in this and the companies have to justify fully what they are doing i do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable and i can understand people being angry about it because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman i know what it  is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high that is the reality of it price rise profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year  the issue of fuel prices has shot to the top of the political agenda since labour leader ed miliband promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he won the next election a pledged branded a con by david cameron shadow energy secretary caroline flint welcomed the archbishops comments saying the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening archbishop welby said the energy companies had a moral obligation to set prices fairly he said they have control because they sell something everyone has to buy we have no choice about buying it with that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society it is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they dont want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit the social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very very seriously indeed archbishop welby added that he was concerned that fuel poverty was a very severe issue because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up it ties in with the food banks and the debt they are all part of the reality of life for many people today the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening shadow energy secretary caroline flint  fuel poverty is defined as when ten per cent or more of a households disposable income is spent on adequate heating following the archbishops comments the mail on sunday discovered that the church of england itself invests heavily in energy firms accounts show the church owns more than 7 million worth of shares in centrica and about 6 million in sse the church says it uses its investments for active engagement with companies and their boards to exert a positive influence british gass price rise announced last week follows an 82 per cent increase by sse other big six suppliers are likely to follow the hike dismayed campaigners who said it was a big nasty shock for families who would have to choose between eating and heating this winter but the suppliers all say they have to put up bills in the face of rising costs sse summed up the position saying we regret having to put our prices but the cost of supplying energy is going up buying it delivering it to homes and the cost of government taxes all cost more than last year and are outside our direct control archbishop welby who worked for french firm elf aquitaine and londonbased enterprise oil before becoming a vicar in coventry said he did not have enough evidence to know if the suppliers were too quick to pass on wholesale rises but slow to pass on price falls profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year to 606 million and managing director chris weston is expected to net 2 million in share bonuses this year on top of a 595000 salary archbishop welby pays the energy bills for his lambeth palace flat out of his annual 74000 stipend but most clergy receive less than 25000 a year wrong place energy minister greg barker said some planners have been too insensitive cannot be at any place at any price minister greg barker  wind farms have scarred  the british landscape and turned the public against the renewable energy agenda an energy minister has conceded greg barker made the admission as he promised that future projects would be located offshore we put certain projects in the wrong place the energy and climate change minister said some planners have been too insensitive to the impact on the landscape and it has turned public opinion against the wider renewable agenda we are very clear about the need to limit the impact on the countryside and landscape it is quite clear the expansion of the  onshore wind rush is over mr barkers comments come amid growing political tension over rising household energy bills and a week after it was revealed that a record number of onshore wind farms have been approved for construction this year between january and august 188 were granted planning permission  a 49 per cent increase on the  same period in 2012 as energy companies continue to lodge applications to take advantage of generous green subsidies mr barker said britain was on course to meet a target that 20 per cent of electricity must come from sustainable sources by 2020 but the minister added that he would write to every council warning they must ban turbines from areas of outstanding natural beauty he said theres enough wind projects in the system now so we dont need to see any more onshore expansion the big area for expansion is offshore where there is scope for larger projects with those projects in the system or under consideration in the planning process at the moment it means we have enough to get to our 2020 targets but it cannot be at any place and at any price,"archbishop of canterbury justin welby criticised energy companies

075baa16014a67a82a84cdb1022b5570fcdee81f,an awful 146word term paper littered with grammatical errors that is barely even readable has become a potent visual symbol of the university of north carolinas fake classes scandal the oneparagraph essay on civil rights icon rosa parks earned an a and was exposed by former unc professor mary willingham who spent 10 years teaching uncs athletes before she turned whistleblower on alleged classroom corruption the shocking essay came to light during an espn documentary timed to coincide with the march madness basketball competition it contains allegations that unc athletes in danger of failing were encouraged to sign up for fake tutor groups designed to let students pass scroll down for a video  allegations of academic fraud this is mary willingham a former student adviser at unc who has claimed that many athletic students at the college were unable to read or write and that fake classes were set up to enable them to play and to graduate  the socalled paper classes were essentially noshow study groups that allowed semiliterate and in some cases illiterate athletes to pass thereby boosting their grade point average to meet the ncaas eligibility requirements the anonymous essay titled rosa parks my story attempts to recount the important moment on december 1 1955 in montgomery alabama when parks refused to give her seat up for a white man however it fails to even place the event in the past or give any gravitas to the momentous moment in american history some of these college students could read at a second or third grade level willingham a unc academic adviser since 2003 told espn students were taking classes that really didnt exist they were called independent studies at that time and they just had to write a paper there was no attendance during the course of her espn interview williams confirmed the existence of easy paper classes and alleged that students were guided to these classes by their academic advisors their job isnt necessarily to make deunta williams a better person a smarter person williams told espn their job is to make sure im eligible to play deunta williams played football at unc from 2007 to 2010 and has admitted to the scam now says he is ashamed to have been involved with it willinghams whistleblowing began in 2011 after she became appalled that unc rather than educating its athletes was keeping them from needing to study at all the paper this is the essay on rosa parks that received an a that mary willingham produced as evidence of apparent academic fraud on an espn special timed to coincide with march madness  she began to release information to journalists about  basketball and football stars who read at a grade school level she confessed herself to steering many young men into lecture classes that simply did not exist and most galling for her given uncs proud history pushing for desegregation that the courses were in africanamerican history willingham began to feed information about alleged academic fraud to the news  observer in raleigh unc is heavily invested in the 16 billion business that is college sports but willinghams revelations threaten that i was part of something that i came to be ashamed of said willingham to bloomberg news in february on the evening of december rosa parks decided that she was going to sit in the  white people section on the bus in montgomery alabama during this time blacks had to give up there seats to whites when more whites got on the bus rosa parks refused to give up her seat her and the bus driver began to talk and the conversation went like this let me have those front seats said the driver she didnt get up and told the driver that she was tired of giving her seat to white people im going to have you arrested said the driver you may do that rosa parks responded two white policemen came in and rosa parks asked them why do you all push us around the police officer replied and said i dont know but the law is the law and youre under arrest we werent serving the kids we werent educating them properly we were pushing them toward graduation and thats not the same as giving them an education when she publicly came forward unc stripped of her supervisory title and denied the allegations of widespread academic fraud unc officials noted in a statement released after the espn report aired that little new information was revealed and noted that the university has used the episode as a chance to improve we have instituted numerous reforms including new governance and accountability standards in our academic support program for studentathletes vice chancellor for communications and public affairs joel curran said in the statement in january senior unc officials publicly condemned her for suggesting that football and basketball stars couldnt read well enough to get through college classes honestly the fake classes were investigated in 2012 and department head julius nyangoro was listed as the instructor for the classes although he calender revealed him to be abroad during some of these he has been charged with a felony for defrauding the university and is currently fighting the charge in court indeed north carolina has been in an academic crisis mode for more than three years shocking mary willingham said her research of 183 football or basketball players at unc from 200412 found 60 percent reading at fourth to eighthgrade levels and roughly 10 percent below a thirdgrade level an ncaa investigation into the football program in 2010 expanded into a probe of how the nations first public university provides academic help to athletes it led to a discovery of fraud in a department with classes featuring significant athlete enrollments now the debate of balancing academics and bigtime sports at the university has been reignited by comments from a reading specialist about the reading levels of football and basketball players it really has just been like weve been under siege for the past three years said lissa lamkin broome a banking law professor and uncs faculty athletic representative in january now to the extent that weve uncovered problems during this siege thats a good thing  to find those problems and weed them out and to try to put processes in place to hopefully ensure  that some of this stuff doesnt happen again in a cnn story that aired in january willingham said her research of 183 football or basketball players at unc from 200412 found 60 percent reading at fourth to eighthgrade levels and roughly 10 percent below a thirdgrade level she said she worked with one mens basketball player early in her 10year tenure who couldnt read or write i dont believe its true unc coach roy williams said in january its totally unfair im really proud of the kids weve brought in here  we havent brought anybody in like that weve had one senior since ive been here that did not graduate allegations mary willingham said she worked with one mens basketball player early in her 10year tenure who couldnt read or write her allegations did not relate to deunta williams  who is pictured here in a game gainst the duke blue devils in 2009 anybody can make any statement they want to make but that is not fair the university of north carolina doesnt do that the university of north carolina doesnt stand for that willingham has said in interviews that she has received death threats and hate mail unc police spokesman randy young said investigators have contacted her and are responding appropriately broome said willingham had shared her findings previously but hasnt provided data that led to her conclusions if marys data uncovers issues that would be helpful to us in our admissions process or in our academic support process then i want to know about those so we can benefit from whatever work she has done  in moving forward and doing things better broome said admissions director stephen farmer a review group member said his office wont hesitate to tell coaches no if a recruit cant handle coursework we do not rubberstamp anyone for admission farmer said we evaluate students for admission and we decide whether the students are capable of succeeding academically at unc thats about as plain as i can make it the topic of balancing academics and athletics isnt unique to unc such as the ap reporting in 2011 that 39 schools had at least 50 percent of football players clustering in one two or three majors but the scope of problems here has often left officials sifting through what happened as much as looking ahead in december a grand jury indicted nyangoro for receiving 12000 to teach one of the noshow classes in summer 2011 a lecture course that was instead treated as an independent study requiring a paper the enrollment was 18 football players and one explayer,"a terrible 146word term paper on rosa parks that received an a from university of north carolina is released 
whistleblower mary willingham claims that it is just one example of academic fraud at the institution 
willingham alleges athletes were guided towards fake classes and gifted grades to comply with ncaa guidlines 
unc denies academic fraud is widespread and claims that only one professor  who has been suspended  was responsible"

set decorations these aliens are among the items to be auctioned off by 20th century props during a tour of his huge north hollywood california warehouse schwartz owner of 20th century props opened a morgue vault door revealing the legs of a crusty corpse built for the xfiles tv series fun piece he said with a smile love the sound effects schwartz must now sell everything  including a submarine a

the end of hollywood as i know it and for everyone because there wont be any place to get all these products again schwartz said while 2009 has been a good year at the box office more production is leaving los angeles for states that offer tax incentives unmatched by california its very very tough said jack kyser economist for the los angeles economic development commission if you are doing feature film production you are probably going to go out of state because 44 other states have been offering incentives for feature film productions california just started their incentive program with companies spending less on advertising in a down economy broadcast tv is suffering and people who make commercials have less work kyser said the writers strike last year and the stalled actors union contract talks added to the slowdown and its getting even tougher for struggling young actors and writers pursuing their hollywood dreams he said we have a slang phrase theres a lot of wams out there waiters actors models kyser said and if you go to restaurants you see the wait staff is looking better and better all the time physically stephon fuller an actor who moved to los angeles 11

of the year including a 50 percent loss in feature film production in los angeles according to a group that helps process filming permits if you are doing a feature film you have to rent equipment you have to rent props kyser said if you go out on location you have to rent a truck to take you there you have to have a location caterer and all these people are feeling the pain schwartz 67 started suffering last year with a 40 percent drop in business and it has gotten worse in recent months i just cant hold on any longer he said ive run out of money an auctioneer will begin the long process of selling everything tuesday morning i talk lightly that i have 93752 pieces under this roof but it doesnt really strike a note until you start putting a little auction lot number on each piece or a bunch of pieces potential bidders have registered from dozens of countries and hundreds are expected to show up at the warehouse schwartz said visitors can be overwhelmed by what they see in schwartz warehouse the largest item on the block is a 162footlong submarine built for down periscope a 1996 comedy starring kelsey grammer its not seaworthy  since it actually never left a movie sound stage  and it will be an expensive job moving it complete with torpedoes it has been used in several tv productions in recent years schwartz said the nuclear warhead john travolta used in his 1996 film

today stepped up government pressure on muirfield golf club to end its ban on women members as the prestigious open championship began at the historic course the prime minister condemned policies which look more to the past than they do to the future while his deputy tore into the inexplicable and anachronistic rules culture secretary maria miller is boycotting the open in protest as her labour opponent harriet harman called for maleonly clubs to be banned by law row david cameron and nick clegg spoke out against the anachronistic maleonly rules which they said belong in the past  teeing off the controversy erupted as play got under way at the open championship which is being held at muirfield golf club east lothian but boycotted by senior ministers  muirfield in east lothian has been home to the honourable company of edinburgh golfers  one of the oldest clubs in the world  since 1891 scotlands first minister alex salmond  culture secretary mrs miller and sport minister hugh robertson have  all announced they will boycott this weeks golf for its perceived  sexism however it has faced a storm of controversy in the runup to the open because it still refuses to admit women members the prime ministers spokesman said mr cameron was not attending the open and entirely understands why mrs miller was not going asked about allmale clubs he added the prime minister has a great deal of sympathy with the view that exclusive memberships of this sort look more to the past than they do to the future mr clegg used his lbc 973 phonein  to voice his opposition to the maleonly policy i was just dismayed  and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age i find it so out of step with everything else thats happening in the rest of society i think many people will just shake their head and say how on earth is this still possible in this day and age demand for action maria miller wants further action after the offensive comments were made  however the head of golfs governing body claimed maleonly golf clubs are for some  people a way of life that they rather like peter dawson chief executive of the  royal and ancient insisted that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs he said yesterday i really dont think that a golf club  that has a policy of being a place where likeminded men or indeed women  go play golf together and do their thing together ranks up against  some of these other forms of discrimination for some people it is a way of life  they rather like i dont think they are intending to do others down you can dress it up to be a lot more if you want but if on a sunday morning the guy or  the lady gets out of the marital bed if you like and plays golf with  his chums and comes back in the afternoon  that is not on any kind of  par with racial discrimination or antisemitism the row comes after culture secretary mrs miller also delivered an extraordinary attack on the bbcs sexist sports coverage in a scathing letter to the directorgeneral lord hall she expressed her anger at presenter john inverdales remarks about wimbledon singles champion marion bartoli mrs miller who also called for better coverage of womens sport demanded updates on further action that is likely to be taken over the comments which prompted hundreds of complaints to the bbc earlier this month inverdale who is thought to be paid about 600000 a year said of miss bartoli during coverage of the wimbledon womens final i just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12 13 14 maybe listen you are never going to be you know a looker you are never going to be somebody like a maria sharapova youre never going to be 5 feet 11 youre never going to be somebody with long legs so you have to compensate for that you are going to have to be the most dogged determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it and she kind of is the comments generated more than 700 complaints and led to demands that inverdale should be sacked but the 55yearold escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the french champion and apologising onair the day after the final french tennis player marion bartoli was the subject of inverdales comments the beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the duchess of cornwalls appearance  she told lord hall i am writing to express my concern over the comments made by john inverdale about marion bartoli during the bbcs radio coverage of the wimbledon womens final she added it is  a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the uks and indeed the worlds sporting calendar i am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience whilst i note that mr inverdale has  apologised both onair and in writing to ms bartoli i would be grateful  for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken  following the complaints and whether there may be positive steps that  the bbc could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and  commentary on female athletes and womens sport generally are as  positive and inclusive as possible the 55yearold escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the french champion and apologising onair the day after the final  the letter was also copied to the chairman of the bbc trust lord patten inverdale  is already set to be replaced as the bbcs main athletics presenter by a  woman gabby logan who agreed that his comments on bartoli wasnt  appropriate the beleaguered inverdale faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the duchess of cornwalls appearance in a radio

inappropriate statement and for the offence caused as he said onair the following day he has written to marion bartoli to apologise and the bbc has also apologised for johns remarks he added that the bbc has a proud record of supporting womens sport with the current coverage of euro 2013 the womens football european championships the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage of

britains biggest insurance company will continue to receive his salary of 80000 a month for the next year despite his humiliating resignation yesterday andrew moss who has quit as chief executive of aviva after a shareholder revolt will receive a golden goodbye worth around 175million in total last thursday 59 per cent of shareholder votes failed to back his goldplated pay package worth up to 52million last year it was the latest chapter in the growing backlash against boardroom greed nicknamed the shareholder spring yesterday the 54yearold chief executive said he felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership but mr moss who has also sparked public criticism for leaving his wife of 25 years and their four children for a junior married colleague deidre galvin in 2009 will not be leaving emptyhanded walked aviva group chief executive andrew moss who is to step down with immediate effect  he will be paid his 960000 basic annual salary for the next year equal to 80000 a month unless he finds another job mr moss will also get a 300000 bonus payment a cash injection of 209000 into his pension pot in five years time deferred shares from a 2009 bonus currently worth around 236000 and a maximum of 45000 in legal and other expenses he has two pensions from aviva one worth around 530000 and one worth around 275million including the 209000 payment mr mosss departure was announced on the eve of todays queens speech which is expected to fire the starting gun on a crackdown on boardroom excess and empower shareholders to veto any examples of corporate excess bounce shares in the uks largest insurer jumped five per cent following the announcement suggesting investors approve of mr mosss departure  investor backing the announcement was immediately followed by a spike in avivas shares  at present shareholders can vote  against pay deals but their votes are not binding on the company and  directors can still receive the controversial pay and bonuses the main  role of such votes is to embarrass bosses and damage the firms  reputation the mood of investors has turned ugly recently triggering  the departure of bosses at drugs company astrazeneca and newspaper group  trinity mirror turmoil avivas st helens skyscraper looms in the city where three ceos have quit amid recent shareholder anger  yesterday  the chief executive of william hill ralph topping was the latest  victim with nearly 50 per cent of the betting firms shareholders  voting against a 12million bonus and a 83 per cent pay rise at its  annual meeting one angry shareholder said chief executives are dining  in the last chance saloon trying to take as much as they can as soon as  possible business  secretary vince cable who has heavily criticised boardroom excess said  bosses are finally being brought back to reality he welcomed the  uprising by shareholders as a healthy development and said he is  determined to stamp out rewards for failure since  mr moss became chief executive in july 2007 avivas share price has  more than halved decimating the nest eggs of thousands of its smaller  shareholders liberal democrat  lord oakeshott said shareholder votes must be binding otherwise it  just like a jury who acquit a man of a murder charge but the judge still  gives him 20 years whats the point deborah  hargreaves of the high pay centre campaign group said the irony is  that aviva was behind some of the recent pay revolts but at the same  time they were not looking after their own backyard this  is what makes mr mosss payoff so intolerable avivas corporate  governance arm was lecturing others about pay and yet the company was  ignoring its own advice mr  moss ceased to be chief executive with immediate effect yesterday but  he will not officially leave until the end of the month meanwhile the average pay of bosses at britains biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to 365million according to research published yesterday the study compiled for the bbc by manifest the adviser to shareholders looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the ftse 100

the average worker in the private sector is losing ground according to a report from the pay experts incomes data services the average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cashstrapped workers between january and march was 3 per cent it says it comes at a time when inflation is 35 per cent the report found that 8 per cent of workers who typically are employed in manufacturing construction

0089064db0f5619d38cad4aa831cdd32e7616356,texas governor rick perry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1000 texas national guard troops to his states southern border which is also the us border with mexico there  can be no national security without border security and texans have paid too  high a price for the federal governments failure to secure our border the republican governor said at a news conference this afternoon the action i am ordering today will tackle this crisis headon by  multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity human traffickers and  individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across texas and  america according to a memo leaked late last night to the monitor the executive action will cost texas taxpayers 12 million a month scroll down for video  done waiting around texas governor rick perry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1000 texas national guard troops to the states southern border which is also the us border with mexico  already perry has instructed the texas department of public safety to increase personnel in the rio grande river valley area at a weekly cost of 13 million added together the two measures will cost 5 million a week the memo reportedly states and it is not clear where the money will come  from in the budget other than non critical areas like health care or transportation the rise in border protection measures follows a surge of central american children streaming into the us from mexico more than 57000 immigrant children many of whom are unaccompanied have illegally entered the country since last year and the government estimates that approximately 90000 will arrive by the close of this year us border patrol has been overloaded by the deluge and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children congress is in the process of reviewing a 37 billion emergency funding request from president barack obama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved but house republicans remain skeptical of the presidents plan roughly half of the money obamas asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries furthermore republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from noncontiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home the judicial process often takes months and even years clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process the president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to congress that would have allowed the department of homeland security to exercise the discretion to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home obama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from democratic lawmakers perry held a news conference with attorney general greg abbott right this afternoon in austin texas to formally announce the deployment perry said the national guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the us illegally  also not included in obamas request to congress was funding for a national guard deployment to the border  something house speaker john boehner and the texas governor had both called on the president to do republicans say a national guard presence is needed at areas of high crime to help border patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels in a face to face meeting with obama when the president came to texas two weeks ago perry again asked the president to deploy the national guard through a federally funded statue but obama resisted perry is now taking matters into his own hands sending his own set of troops down to the rio grande valley to aid law enforcement officials state senator juan chuy hinojosa a democrat who represents border town mcallen criticized the republican governors deployment as unnecessary the cartels are taking advantage of the situation he told the monitor but our local law enforcement from the sheriffs offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation this is a civil matter not a military matter what we need is more resources to hire more deputies hire more border patrol hinojosa said these are young people just families coming across theyre not armed theyre not carrying weapons the leaked memo on the national guard deployment specifically denies that it is a militarization of the border however and perrys office reiterated today that troops would work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials hinojosa also accused perry who recently toured the border with sean hannity as part of a special for fox news of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border all  these politicians coming down to border they dont care about solving  the problem they just want to make a political point he said,"texas governor rick perry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1000 texas national guard troops to the border 
the deployment will cost texas taxpayers 12 million a month according to a leaked memo 
perry has asked obama multiple times to send the national guard to the border but obama keeps refusing 
a texas lawmaker said the republican governor is not sincerely concerned about the border he just wants to play politics"

if isis is seen as a terrorist organization with the potential to engage in terrorist acts beyond the middle east then that could warrant the targeting of high value targets said petraeus he referenced the complicated sectarian friction that currently exists in iraq between sunni and shia muslims we must be careful not to take sides if we offer military support but the growing threat posed by isis means that military action will be necessary said petraeus to the daily telegraph leader of the surge former us general david petraeus l walks with his entouage in the shorja market area

syria and iraq could become havens for terrorist planners and was disappointed that iraq has descended into chaos again i certainly do not think it was in vain he said to the daily telegraph the surge provided iraq with an excellent opportunity however it is undeniably very sad to see the tragic turn of events in iraq knowing personally how great the sacrifice and the cost was for the us britain

iraq  on thursday president barack obama announced his intention today to send up to 300 us military advisers into iraq to help train the countrys military the president expressly stated that the move does not foreshadow a military intervention and said sending troops back into iraq to fight radical extremists would not benefit the us american forces will not be returning to combat in iraq obama said  but we will help iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the iraqi people the region and american interests as well the president also said the us was currently identifying targets associated with the islamic state of iraq and syria terrorist group and that the us would take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it  an obvious nod to air strikes president barack obama announced today that the us would send in up to 300 soldiers to train and advise the iraqi military american forces still wont be engaging in combat he promised  after meeting with national security advisers early this afternoon the president said in a statement that the us intended would coordinate with iraqi security forces put up joint operation centers in baghdad and share intelligence with the iraqi government already the president had deployed 275 armed marines to protect state department personnel working at the embassy in baghdad he had also sent the uss george hw bush aircraft carrier with  its usual battleship escort the uss mesa verde an amphibious transport  ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters and armed f18 super hornet warplanes to do surveillance obama told members of congress during a meeting on wednesday that he did not need their permission to take the actions he was considering however he said on thursday that he would continue to work with congress to provide additional equipment to the iraqi military through his newly created counterterrorism partnership fund and that he would consult congress as well as iraqi leaders if he decided to pull the trigger on air strikes iraqi  prime minister nouri almaliki a shiite has asked president obama for air  strikes against the sunni islamist militants who have been carving a  wide swath through his country but obama has been slow to comply the president told congressional leaders yesterday that the us does not have strong enough intelligence at this time to carry out the strikes an aide with knowledge of the discussion told the huffington post yesterday obama also expressed anxiety about the number of civilian casualties that the strikes could cause as well concerns about instability within iraqs government the president said last week that he would not provide iraq with military assistance until the countrys leaders made serious moves toward putting their sectarian differences aside standing up for themselves more than 200000 iraqis have volunteered to defend their country including this group of farmers  vice president joe biden spoke on wednesday with maliki the countrys sunni parliamentary speaker and the the  president of the countrys selfruled kurdish region he  praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in  a televised show of unity against isis the white house said lawmakers  have been putting pressure on obama to call for malikis resignation  for days and the associated press said reported thursday morning that  obama might ask maliki to resign as a hail mary effort to stop the  countrys civil war however obama repeatedly said on thursday its not the place for the united states to choose iraqs leaders there  is an urgent need for iraq to convene a new parliament that gives all  iraqis the sense that they are part of a unity government though obama said right now what is happening is the fate of iraq hangs in the balance the us president hedged when asked at a presser thursday after his statement if he had lost faith in maliki to lead  the country and referred back to his previous statements us president barack obama meets with congressional leadership including senate majority leader harry reid 2nd r senate minority leader mitch mcconnell l house speaker john boehner 2nd l and house minority leader nancy pelosi r in the oval office of the white house on june 18 2014 in washington dc the leaders met to discuss strategy on iraq  former us general david petraeus  who led the surge that finally brought calm to iraq struck a cautious  note on western intervention on wednesday speaking  at a conference in london general petraeus said the iraqi government  needed to reach out to the sunni minority before the us got involved  militarily he said if  the us is to support the iraqi government it would have to be a  government against terrorism rather than one side in a civil war this  cannot be the united states being the air force for shia militias or a  shia on sunni arab fight he told the margaret thatcher conference on  liberty president obama  expressed concern at doing just that on thursday and again called on  iraqs government to come together to fight the common treat to their  nation he also fired a warning shot at iran the  us welcomes the country to play a constructive role in iraq he  said but if iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of  the shia and it is framed in that fashion that probably worsens the  situation obviously  what has happened in syria in part is the result of iran coming in hot  and heavy on one side obama said referring to the upheaval in that

by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo  missions its not so much about looking as it is being seen the official said the white  house told reporters on wednesday afternoon that the president is still  undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that  once hosted 143000 american servicemen and women obama said on thursday that he would prefer iraqs neighbors in the region step up instead on that note obama said he would be sending secretary of state john kerry to the middle east and europe to meet with the uss allies abroad about working together to quell the violence in iraq rather than play whackamole where these terrorist networks pop up the president said the us has to be able to build effective partnerships the big picture isis

population of less than 1000 solidarity tax as romas francesco totti during a preseason game in valencia spain serie a stars could go on strike over tax hikes on those earning more than 150000 euros

legally abolished portofino has a population of only 479 during the winter as tourists travel elsewhere while laglio has just 957 people living there the proposals have sparked a storm of criticism in

players should pay not the clubs he told the corriere della sella those making 90000 euros will have to pay it i dont see why those who make millions shouldnt do it otherwise as far as im concerned the players can go on strike for the rest of their lives ac milan is owned by prime minister berlusconi whose government approved the measures most top players especially foreign stars negotiate their net income upon joining a team and it is then up to the club to handle their fiscal obligations abolished lagio on the shores of lake como where us actor george clooney owns this home is another town which could disappear under the municipality merger  this was allowed under the old collective agreement but the new one  which has not yet been signed  leaves it up to players alone to pay their taxes the conflict between the players and the league has been going on since the last collective agreement expired in june last year two strike dates were set during the last season both of which were avoided with lastminute verbal agreements the supercuts will affect 8100 municipalities across italy around 29 of the countrys 110 provinces will also disappear along with more than 50000 jobs

excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity it can also make you look old too a diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness nutritionist brooke alpert and dermatologist dr patricia farris explain why in their new book the sugar detox they write so do people who eat too much sugar really look older the answer is a resounding yes in a large study published in the journal age 602 people were examined by independent evaluators moment on the lips lifetime on the face too much sugar can prematurely age your skin  healthy people with lower blood sugars  typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars  and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age they explain too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin simply put it makes skin unhealthy skin is our largest organ one of its main functions called barrier function is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution dirt bacteria and fungi anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections some very interesting recent studies have shown that longterm hyperglycemia too much sugar in the blood leaves skin more vulnerable this explains why diabetics and others with longstanding hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin this is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin pamper and protect nutritionist brooke alpert left and dermatologist dr patricia farris have developed a diet plan and skincare regime to help people look younger  the pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age making it wrinkly and saggy and poor nutrition can accelerate this process but they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan as previously reported in the mailonline the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar on the low carb plan dairy fruit with the exception of lemon and lime starches wheat and any added sugars are all banned some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses the pair say going cold turkey for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar the foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body  and especially for the skin for example they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production turn back the clock swap coffee with added sugar

oatmeal is a  natural antiinflammatory honey has healing properties and acts as a  natural moisturizer and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants at meal times they recommend  regularly consuming fish high in omega 3 such as salmon this is because  they contain essential fatty acids that are the building blocks for  the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated when  it comes to drinks their superhero product for the skin is green tea   which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers they also  recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under  eye bags and puffiness they  explain why its so good for helping the skin look more youthful  studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively  blocks collagen

015a8c6844420202dafaf8aa88e51f83c2747ab0,england is the only developed country producing school leavers who are worse at maths and reading than their grandparents according to a damning report the study found 16 to 24yearolds are among the least literate and numerate in the world lagging behind those in countries including estonia poland and the slovak republic england came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development damning report an international study has found that the uks young people are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world file picture the figures showed many japanese school leavers are more advanced than english university graduates the oecd said england was the only country where the oldest age group  studied 5565 had a higher proficiency in  literacy and numeracy than the youngest 1624 after other factors such as sex socioeconomic background and type of occupation were taken into account the organisation warned england would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken the tories said the report exposed the failings of labour during its 13 years in power these are labours children educated under a labour government and forcefed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations said skills and enterprise minister matthew hancock labour came to power in 1997 after tony blair pledged his priority would be education education education england was the only country in developed world in which those aged 5565 performed better than 1624yearolds  todays  findings show that the billions poured into education by labour failed  to push up standards of literacy and numeracy critics have said the  government has claimed that the oecds research underlines who  labours children educated under a labour government and forcefed a  diet of dumbing down and low expectations official  figures from the office for national statistics have shown that  labours spending on education rose from 353billion in 2000 to  639billion in 2009 yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations last year a different report found despite tony blair declaring his priorities as education education  education when he swept to power in 1997 a huge increase in spending  on schools led to no improvement in student learning outcomes the oecd study  education at a glance  found that expenditure on  uk primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of gdp  increased from 36 per cent in 1995 to 45 per cent in 2009 higher than  the oecd average of four per cent at the same time there has been no improvement in student learning outcomes the report said  spending in the sector soared by 78  per cent from 50billion to 89billion by the time the party lost the  election in 2010 during this period gcse and alevel grades rose every  year which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down andreas  schleicher of the oecd said young adults had more qualifications than  those nearing retirement but not greater abilities this indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills the finding doesnt look good for the uk mr schleicher said the 466page study was the first carried out by the oecd into the work skills of 16  to 65yearolds establishing their abilities in literacy numeracy and problem solving a total of 166000 were interviewed in 24 countries including 9000 in england and northern ireland scotland and wales were not covered the study found a quarter of adults in england 85million have the maths skills of a tenyearold with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers literacy levels are also below average with 164 per cent of adults 58million reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school just 424 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving this was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 507 per cent and 21 behind the bestperforming country south korea not moving forward this chart from the report shows how britains young people and older people are roughly at the same level whereas countries like korea are showing huge improvement between generations  picture of britain this graph shows how the uk compared to other industrial nations when it came to numeracy  interesting countries like japan netherlands and sweden were the top performing in terms of literacy even though children start school often years later than british youngsters  england produced 8 per cent of the worlds most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s this has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue the report said the talent pool of highly skilled adults in england is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries in the next few decades the slide could be reversed only if significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people england also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood one positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent resulting in high productivity and wages the coalition has taken steps to improve education demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher the number of top gcse and alevel grades has now decreased for the past two years john allan of the federation of small businesses said the oecd report highlights what our members tell us  that young people dont have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly we need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age the shadow education secretary tristram hunt defended labours record saying it drove up standards in maths and english across our schools evident in the huge improvements we saw in gcse results between 1997 and 2010 failed the government said today this generation of young people are labours children forcefed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations mike harris of the institute of directors said the report underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers realworld experience of interviewing and employing people former labour education and employment secretary david blunkett questioned the oecds methodology and said the report warranted united action not party political point scoring education has undergone massive change since labour began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965 in 1988 gcses replaced olevels and the national curriculum was introduced and in 1997 labour abolished the assisted places scheme awarding free places at feepaying schools to gifted children from low or middleincome families the academy schools programme began in 2000 with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control in 2010 the coalition launched free schools which are similar to academies  but can be set up by groups including

022713fd20ac0ffd0ddccec6d9389beedd681893,president barack obama will speak to the nation tuesday trying to build public support for a military strike against syria his request to congress to endorse action reaches the house and senate at an extraordinarily difficult moment vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking democrats and republicans are uncertain about backing the president the public remains skeptical as well according to one nbc poll only 42 of the public endorsed using military force against syria after afghanistan and iraq the nation is weary of war the bar has been raised for further intervention although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion obama must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing if obama is going to deliver a speech that matters he must answer some basic questions about the syrian intervention  why are we entering this conflict for many americans the arguments behind american intervention in syria remain murky this is not just about syria being a confusing and complex situation but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of american foreign policy in 2013 in each era of foreign policy policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace each period had substantial numbers of dissenters but at least there was something concrete to argue about during the 1930s and early 1940s the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention yesterday december 7 1941  a date which will live in infamy  the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan president franklin d roosevelt explained the next day when asking congress for a declaration of war from the mid1940s through the late 1980s the fight against communism was the focal point of policy since that time the objectives of american foreign policy have been less clear when president truman asked for congressional support to use military power in korea in july 1950 he said that the conflict in korea has made it clear beyond all doubt that the international communist movement is willing to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations in the early 1990s policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as iraq that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions after 911 attention turned to international terrorist networks like al qaeda on september 20 2001 president bush told the nation the enemy of america is not our many muslim friends it is not our many arab friends our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them the larger framework surrounding the syrian intervention is less clear the administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the united states needs to intervene from the message it would send to iran about nuclear weapons to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights the president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources if humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts what is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence one of the main sources of public cynicism about american foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs american history is filled with such examples the gulf of tonkin resolution in 1964 which provided president lyndon johnson the blanket authority he needed to expand americas presence in vietnam and the region was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on us navy destroyers by the north vietnamese congress gave johnson wideranging authority to conduct military operations it was like grandmas nightshirt it covered everything he later said president george w bushs request to congress for the authorization to use force in iraq in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between saddam hussein and osama bin laden obama who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with bushs war needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence the revelations about the national security agency have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what obama says in public and what he does behind the scenes without revealing sensitive information to the public it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound that it has been examined and crossexamined that the syrian government did use chemical weapons and that the syrians do pose a substantial threat to the region he needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction why act here but not with regard to other atrocities or risks the nation cannot afford another war based on false premises what is the mission presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve once troops are sent into a war or even after the air force is sent in to strike targets conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly if the administration doesnt articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset it allows for openended possibilities for escalation when president george hw bush went to war with iraq in 1990 the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when americans saw that hussein remained in power after the celebrations of us victory had taken place bushs sons war in iraq proved even more frustrating as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nationbuilding than many americans had anticipated when the new government that emerged from the rubble in iraq remained unstable and the us seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country many americans were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile obama cant afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives illdefined it is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the syrians though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has  characterized as inhumane and brutal it is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change the president did the right thing by engaging congress in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch but in this case with the memories of iraq looming large he wont have luck just asking for blind support in his speech the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms this would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed,"julian zelizer president obama must answer basic questions to sell syria move to the public

01481086a0345380b54bc7e2ba6acb72d61b3a67,cnn  the darkness ii is a gorefilled bloodenraged slaughterfest that really wants to be a feelgood love story oh and you get to fight with characters who have four arms set a couple of years after the conclusion of the original game in this series players control jackie estacado a crime boss who is also host to an ancient evil known as the darkness this force imbues jackie with superhuman powers including two extra arms  called demon arms in the game  that look like snakes with piranhas for heads its scary stuff and these extra arms are essential for ingame combat jackie has been keeping the darkness bottled up inside but there are others who want the power for themselves as the game starts out the darkness gets released and helps jackie in his war against the brotherhood at its core the darkness ii is a firstperson shooter that adds in the demon arms and provides four different opportunities of attack the shooting aspect is solid with plenty of different weapons to choose from and allows jackie the ability to carry around two sets of weapons at least sometimes when youre carrying four weapons with four arms thats when the action and thats where it really gets bloody the two arms which resemble snakes with piranha heads can lash out at opponents grab and destroy doors and fences and help gather essence  the element that helps jackie increase his powers the arms also have some pretty bloody and cool finishing moves that raise the gore to medschooldissectionclass levels opponents get various extremities ripped off and tossed aside or violently torn in two using the legs as a wishbone the more gruesome the kill the more essence can be collected and the stronger jackie can become by spending essence on improved weapons special demon arm kill bonuses or super powers using four arms to fight enemies works fairly naturally but does get a little hectic in some of the group battles in trying to gain as much essence as possible i found myself rushing toward distance opponents to grapple with the demon arms but taking a bunch of damage along the way eventually i decided just to pick off faraway bad guys with weapons and wait for the grunts to come rushing to me in the game there is no minimap or radar to let you know where the villains are located and there will be times you just have to get hit to find out there was someone behind you enemies do spawn from every direction  even places you just cleared out  so be prepared to swivel around a lot the artwork in the game is very graphicnoir with a handpainted look it looks great gritty exteriors colorful interiors and a hellscape that was foreboding helps immerse the player in whatever environment they were in each area was distinct with the appropriate overall emotional landscape darklings are back from the first title or i should say a darkling is back these physical manifestations of the darkness in your brain were used as weapons in the previous game this time there is only one and he acts more like a sidekick than a destroyer looking like an agile goblin the darkling provides some good comedic moments but hes also handy in distracting opponents getting into tight places and shortcircuiting electrical boxes when needed there is also a point in the game where jackie takes over the darkling and you get to directly control it the new viewpoint makes for a nice change of pace for all these gameplay nuances however the story of the darkness ii is where the game developers really wanted to make their mark jackie still mourning over the murder of his girlfriend has visions of her in the early part of the game players discover an eternal love between the two that eventually crosses over the barriers between life and death that type of romantic story plays out mostly in cut scenes and cinematics this love stuff felt jarring and out of place at times when compared to the brutality of the battles do you get invested in the story sure however there are a few disjointed moments that left me scratching my head and wondering what it all meant also the game seemed short compressed action and lengthy cut scenes did nothing to make the adventure last and the ending came around too quickly so i was a little disappointed when i realized the story was coming to a close overall the darkness ii is a solid shooter that gets amplified by the fact that you get to fight with four arms using the demon arms to rip opponents to shreds or fling them into the sky never seems to get old oh and much like todays movies stick around after the credits youll really want to see this the darkness ii is available in north america on february 7 and in europe on february 10 it can be played on windows pc playstation 3 and xbox 360 the game is rated unsurprisingly m for mature due to blood and gore drug references intense violence strong language and strong sexual content this review was done with the limited edition version for the ps3,"players control jackie estacado a crime boss

when he lost control of his silver vauxhall corsa sri at 70mph in a 50mph zone hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall the car burst into flames and leanne davies a trainee hairdresser who was in the front passenger seat died at the scene from severe head injuries leanne davies a trainee hairdresser had sneaked away from her parents on the night of the fatal tragedy because they disapproved of her onandoff relationship with her boyfriend paul reddan an engineer  a number of witnesses said paul reddan had been driving on the wrong side of the road while he had been allegedly racing with matthew creed on a stretch of road for at least two miles before the fatal crash  reddan an engineer was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for six years and banned from driving for five years at gloucester crown court today sentencing judge jamie tabor said leanne was by all accounts a lovely young girl she had the world before her  then her life was taken away by this absolutely ludicrous driving he told reddan who turned 21 today i have no doubt at all that you were racing that night from the moment you got in the car you were driving too fast you were racing in such a way that one witness thought someone would get killed you had been racing for a very long part of your journey in a very dangerous manner you lost control of your vehicle and you killed leanne  that is the long and short of it the crumpled vauxhall corsa which reddan had bought just three months before the crash in gloucester  the court heard how leanne of lydbrook glos secretly met up with reddan on the night of may 31 last year because her parents did not approve of their onoff relationship she told them she was going to meet her grandmother but actually went for food at mcdonalds with reddan before getting into his car at around 9pm but while travelling along the a4136 near longhope glos he lost control on a bend hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall matthew creed 19 was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving in the sixday trial which ended today  it was alleged he was racing matthew creed 19 who was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was cleared after a sixday trial a number of witnesses described how reddans corsa had been very close to mr creeds renault clio and at one point it was even being driven on the wrong side of the road the prosecution alleged that the two men had been racing each other for at least two miles before the fatal crash which left reddan hospitalised for three weeks one witness andrew barnes who saw the two cars flash past less than a car length apart only a few hundred metres before the collision said someone is going to die the court heard leannes parents paul and heather said their whole family had been affected by the loss of the hairdresser  an examination of reddans car following the incident showed the speedometer stuck at 60mph the back tyres underinflated and a defect in the brake pipe it was concluded that the cars faults in combination with the manner of driving could have caused the vehicle to become unstable in a victim impact statement read in court leannes father paul davies said the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family we recently attended a family wedding and i could not stop thinking about the fact i will never get to walk my only daughter down the aisle father paul davies said in a victim impact statement read in court today that the the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family and that he was angry over the loss  whatever the outcome of this case and whatever the sentence paul will always have his life and future but leanne will never have that mr davies said the loss of his daughter had affected every single aspect of my life and he was angry he would never be able to walk her down the aisle for her wedding one day his two sons luke and mitch had been badly affected too and the whole family had received counselling and support he said the biggest surprise after this incident is that there has been absolutely no remorse shown by paul reddan whatsoever we received one letter from him but he didnt even say he was sorry he did say i am sorry you lost leanne but there was no hint of sorrow or regret about what had happened leanne davies parents paul and heather pictured left with the family liaison officer pc steve martin and one of leannes brothers luke davies outside  gloucester crown court following the sentencing of paul reddan  it appears to have had no effect on him whatsoever heather davies leannes mother said at just 19 she had her whole life ahead of her her dreams and ambitions will now be unfulfilled because of the events of that night she said leanne had an argument with her dad that night about a forthcoming family holiday and whether reddan would be joining them because of the onoff nature of their relationship at that time  mr davies had regretted the row ever since because it had been the last time he saw his daughter the couple were asleep on the sofa in front of the tv at midnight when police arrived to tell them leanne had been killed said mrs davies i will never be able to forgive paul reddan for what happened that night she said the crumpled corsa after the fatal crash which claimed the life of trainee hairdresser leanne davies 19  my only hope is that one day life will become easier and i can remember leanne for who she was my beautiful loving daughter jason coulter acting for reddan said he had led an honest and industrious life and had no previous convictions  and was never likely to offend again he accepted however that not long before the tragedy reddan had been driving at 120mph when a passenger took a picture of his speedometer mr coulter said that although reddan had not appeared remorseful in public his mother had seen him in tears at home and he very much mourns the passing of leanne the solicitor also handed the judge a letter written by reddan expressing his sorrow reddan had worked for his employers for two and a half years had completed an engineering apprenticeship and was earning 25000 as a buyer of equipment for industrial pipework he added the court heard that the back tyres of reddans corsa were underinflated and there was a defect in the brake pipe and in combination with the manner of driving could have caused the vehicle to become unstable  reddan of broadwell glos had passed his test in january 2012 and had got the 18 litre car less than three months before the smash the court heard passing sentence judge tabor told reddan he had not seen any remorse from him and he had cut an arrogant figure in the witness box showing a lack of sensitivity to leannes parents the judge said he was satisfied reddan had been racing for a very prolonged period in a very dangerous manner reddan was told he will have to take an extended test before driving again and he will have to pay a 120 surcharge in addition to the jail term and ban leannes family released a statement after todays sentencing in which they said we the family of leanne davies welcome the verdict handed down by the court today we wish to thank the court mr tully and his team at the cps and the police for their meticulous investigation into the truth of what happened that tragic evening our lives have been on hold since that night whilst mr reddan has been able to carry on with his showing no remorse whatsoever for his actions we hope that with this trial now over we can start to move on with our lives and focus on our many fond memories of leanne and finally we would like to thank all of our friends and family for their continued support the officer in charge of the case pc tim griffiths said it is nearly 18 months since the collision and during that time the family of leanne davies have been supported by one of the constabularys family liaison officers leannes family have remained dignified throughout the investigation and court process it has been a long painstaking investigation which has been reliant on the local community from longhope and across the forest of dean who have supported our investigation during this period my thoughts have remained with the family whilst focused on establishing one thing what happened to leanne i remember one thing a promise that i made to them on behalf of the investigation team that we would do our utmost to find out what happened to their daughter this investigation and trial i hope has done just that and though they will never ever get over the loss of their much loved and wellliked daughter i hope that in some small way it helps them to move forward in their lives and to put this terrible tragedy behind them my thoughts and condolences are with all of leannes family and friends at this very difficult time the investigation team and i take no pleasure in this guilty conviction as clearly we would prefer never to have had to conduct this investigation into what is clearly a very sad matter it serves as a reminder to us all that cars particularly when they are driven in such a manner are killers in the wrong hands therefore we must all strive to not only continue to improve the way in which we drive every day but also accept the responsibility that we all have when we take to the road he added during the course of this trial this young man has not taken responsibility for his actions or the part he played in leannes death,"paul reddan was driving his

04c0309a4aeeed4ca58daba49e77e594878e07d2,cnn  in the playgrounds across dortmund they will be reenacting this night for years to come each child will take it in turns to take on the role of felipe santana another will pretend to follow in the footsteps of marco reus while others will fight it out to pull on the imaginary shirt of robert lewandowski it is nights like these which inspire not only those inside the stadium but the next generation of footballers its what makes the intangible tangible trailing 21 to malaga going into stoppage time in tuesdays champions league quarterfinal second leg the dortmund dream lay in tatters this youthful and vibrant side a team which has won admirers from across the globe appeared to have choked when it was supposed to underline its status as one of the most exciting sides in europe but this is football  a sport which still boasts the capacity to leave even the most seasoned of spectators transfixed in a state of disbelief with the clock ticking down and all hope abating dortmund produced one of the most astonishing european comebacks in recent years two goals in added time broke spanish hearts and propelled jurgen klopps side into the semifinals in a manner befitting of its own film script this was hollywood the german side which had held malaga to a goalless draw in the first leg was expected to reach the semifinal with ease and qualify for the last four for the first time since 1998 it was not difficult to see why dortmund was considered such a strong favourite  it plays a brand of football which reawakens the youthful spirit in even the most weary of souls in its yellow and black shirts the players buzz and swarm around like bees pushing pressing and pestering but while dortmund dominated it failed to make that crucial incision instead it was malaga which made the first move giving the game a twist most did not expect to witness joaquins fierce strike found the corner and temporarily silenced the raucous crowd packed inside the stadium but that goal which arrived after 25 minutes only served to stir dortmund into action suddenly dortmund found its spark  and what a spark in the end it was a moment of magic which lit up the dortmund sky as the home side drew level with a sublime demonstration of how to unlock a defense this was not simply a goal no this was a thing of sheer beauty from the moment the ball found its way to marco reus until it hit the back of the net this was football from a different planet reus the precociously talented playmaker unfurled a flick of such cunning that it split the malaga defense and allowed robert lewandowski to clip the ball over the goalkeeper and fire home it was beautiful if barcelona had scored a goal of similar fashion then the world would have stopped and applauded  dortmund are not there yet but this team is showing a potential which should excite those who embrace such pure football but while its attacking prowess was clear to see the backdoor always appeared ajar for a malaga side determined to make light of its financial troubles and secure a last four berth joaquin twice failed to scored with headers when well placed but those misses appeared not to matter when eliseu touched home julio baptistas shot with eight minutes remaining that goal which was converted from an offside position left the home supporters crushed but dortmund refused to be denied and with the game drifting into the 91st minute reus lashed home from close range to level the game at 22 and leave his side needing one more goal with just a couple of minutes left to play malaga needed only to hold out and preserve the 22 scoreline to progress but as the yellow and black shirts poured forward the malaga defense buckled from a seemingly hopeless position the ball was lumped into the penalty area before falling at the feet of santana just a yard from goal he was offside  earlier in the move there were four dortmund players offside  but that didnt stop him the brazilian smashed the ball home the assistant referees flag didnt go up the referee didnt blow the goal stood as malaga fell dortmund had triumphed there is one very disappointed team in this moment and one lucky team klopp told sky sports its unbelievable it was our worst game in the champions league this season and not our best football if we play like tonight we wont win the champions league but we have reached our target of the semifinal malaga which was making its debut in the competition was left shell shocked as it suffered a heartbreaking exit we were four minutes away from the semis striker roque santa cruz told sky sports there is huge disappointment in the dressing room we had the tie in our hands in the nights other game real madrid progressed to the final four despite suffering a 32 defeat in turkey against galatasaray leading 30 from the first leg cristiano ronaldos early strike appeared to kill off any hope the home side might have had of causing an upset but fatih terims men produced an inspired performance with goals from emmanuel eboue wesley sneijder and didier drogba firing it into a 31 lead on the night ronaldo grabbed a late second his 48th goal in 47 games this season to finally end the fightback real finished with 10men after alvaro arbeloa was sent off i wasnt getting nervous because i have no time for it real boss jose mourinho told sky sports i am on the bench so i have no time to think or to feel it they are strong strong mentally they dont play against 11 they play 50000 against 11 and it was hard for us we are there in the semifinals and that is what that matters today is the kind of match where you have everything to lose and nothing to win people think we are already in the semifinal and players that that feeling from the outside i felt the team was ready to work hard and had the motivation to reach wembley in the final i dont know who we will play in the semifinal it will be against a great team

0672440c5c1a906e7010b5829c223be0f6ddc94e,one of the most difficult parts of a trial especially in front of a jury is accurately describing the crime scene a number of courtrooms have begun projecting 3d images of scenes onto walls  but these can only reveal a limited amount of information to take criminal courtroom reconstructions to the next level experts have created a 3d immersive system that virtually transports people inside the scene using an oculus rift headset the setup uses an oculus rift headset d the optitrack optical tracker e laser scanner from geomagic and autodesk 3ds max software to create the final reconstructions the computer system is shown at a b is the oculus usb connector and c is a wallmounted tracker  it has been dubbed forensic holodeck after the environment simulator used in scifi show star trek the lowcost setup uses an oculus rift headset the optitrack optical tracker a laser scanner from geomagic and autodesk 3ds max software to create the final reconstructions it also uses gaming software called unity 3d this creates an immersive world in which the jury judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3d highresolution detail  similar to star treks hologram setup in switzerland scenes are routinely reconstructed by combining 3d laser scans of the scene to postmortem surface scans and medical images such as ct and mri explained lead researcher lars ebert from the from the institute of forensic medicine in zurich to demonstrate the system the researchers chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe pictured the scene was recorded by a surveillance camera and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings the aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room  the lowcost setup uses an oculus rift headset the optitrack optical tracker a laser scanner from geomagic and autodesk 3ds max software to create the final reconstructions this creates an immersive world in which the jury judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3d highresolution detail oculus rift is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time allowing for calculation of the scene with the correct perspective oculus rift pictured is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time  the headset consists of a screen that is split in half delivering half the 1280 x 800 pixel resolution for each eye in the front of the screen two plastic lenses help create a diagonal viewing angle of 110degrees the rift is then connected to the pc using a hdmi cable and a usb transfers information about the head orientation to a computer head orientation is measured using a combination of gyros accelerometers and magnetometers when used for gaming the headset doesnt typically need to use positional information of the head is usually not required to overcome this problem for the forensic holodeck system the researchers added an optical tracker to measure the user position this meant they could freely move inside the virtual scene to demonstrate the system the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe the scene was recorded by a surveillance camera and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings  the aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room the purpose of these reconstructions is to create a visualisation of an event to make it possible for a state attorney or judge to properly assess a situation based on the bullet trajectories visibility speed and distance mr ebert continued however that although the data used for these reconstructions are high resolution and allow for a spatially correct display of the scene they typically use a 3d reconstruction on a 2d display this reduces the amount of spatial information available the technology is similar to the fictional holodeck in star trek pictured with  deanna troi played by marina sirtis left and jonathan frakes as william riker right holodecks were installed on starships space stations and at starfleet for entertainment training and investigative purposes  and although 3d screens partially solve this problem estimating distances is still difficult because the perceived depth depends on the size of the display mr ebert believes his oculus rift system is a solution to this to demonstrate the system the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting during the incident in an internet cafe a known drug dealer was approached by policemen and women in civilian clothes as well as in uniform for the purpose of arresting him a holographic environment simulator or holodeck for short was a form of holotechnology designed and used by starfleet in star trek holodecks were installed on starships space stations and at starfleet institutions for entertainment training and investigative purposes a typical holodeck consisted of a room with a hologrid containing socalled omnidirectional holographic diodes holographic projections could be shown by manipulating photons contained within force fields it was also used in an episode of the next generation called a matter of perspective to recreate the events leading up to a space station explosion for forensic investigations source memory alpha  despite being surrounded the man was able to get up from his chair and draw a handgun one of the policemen managed to grab onto the arm bearing the gun while the others attempted to take cover in the course of the struggle seven gunshots were fired and one of the bullets hit a policeman on his hand the entire scene was recorded by a surveillance camera in one of the top corners of the room and these recordings were used to reconstruct the sequence of events the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings and used to this to pinpoint the final position of the projectiles this along with the camera footage were used to reconstruct every bullet fired the aim of the reconstruction was to show how close the bullet trajectories came to severely injuring one of the people in the room during a police congress we were able to demonstrate the system continued the researchers the comments by the police officers involved in the presented incident were promising further work will be carried out to make the technology more accurate before it is used widely in courtrooms the forensic holodeck an immersive display for forensic crime scene reconstructions was published in the springer journal forensic science medicine and pathology,"the setup was devised by forensic experts from the university of zurich 
it uses an oculus rift optical tracker and autodesk 3ds max software 
camera footage is combined with laser scans to create final reconstruction 
this creates an immersive world in which the jury judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3d highresolution detail

01f41354ffb70e433681ad5fe4b6d69c48e2884b,by  jennifer smith  published  0734 est 12 november 2013    updated  0823 est 12 november 2013  an increasing number of elderly people are renting properties after selling their own homes new data has revealed  an increasing number of retired people are selling their homes and moving into rented accommodation in a desperate bid to access cash experts say overall there has been a seven per cent  increase in the number of tenants aged 66 to 70 moving into rented  homes after selling their own properties in addition half of all regions in the uk saw an increase in older tenants downsizing to rented homes in the past year experts believe many pensioners are being forced to sell up to release equity from their homes as their pension pots dwindle and living costs continue to rise and figures compiled by homelet rental index data suggest pensioners have no choice but to downsize into rented homes as suitable alternatives are being bought by younger firsttime buyers with the help of government initiatives yorkshire and humberside have seen the  largest increase in tenants over the age of 65 while the east midlands  has the highest rate with 31 per cent of pensioners living in rented  accommodation pensions arent providing the same level of contributions they were 30 or 40 years  ago said gary abraham director of sales and marketing at homelet for many elderly people the only equity they have is in their homes and theyre having to unlock income from other sources like selling their houses the government are specifically only helping one demographic new houses are being built for younger people while some elderly people may be forced to sell their homes and downsize to save money others may be moving in to rented accommodation as they feel their money may outlive them says mr abraham a lot of the new homes arent suitable but another thing to consider is that is pensioners could be taking a shortterm view and using their equity to provide a standard of living theyre used to the homelet october 2013 data index breakdown reveals how the price of renting has increased less over the past three years  it appears the demographic of the uk  tenant is changing while initiatives such as the build to rent scheme  are positive moves to alleviate supply the government needs to  consider these purposebuilt properties are not going to be suitable for  all added mr abraham therefore focus must also be kept on  the maintenance of existing properties so all tenants are able to live  in suitable properties depending on their individual needs momentum must be maintained though so those living within the private rented sector are offered the best quality properties and security needed as part of their tenancy agreements the report also revealed that though the cost of  renting has decreased by 46 per cent during the month of october to 815  tenants across the board are still paying 27 per cent more on average than last year when comparing previous years this  months figures show from october 20102013  average uk rents increased less each year after rising by 48 per cent in 2011  31 per cent in 2012 and 27 per cent in 2013 this is also true in the capital  where the rate of increase in average rents slowed down by 23 per cent between  october 201112 and four per cent between october 201213 the east midlands greater london and  the north west were the only regions where rental costs increased with  properties in the north west costing 45 per cent more to rent than  last year and those in the capital almost 21 per cent more than in  2010 our new figures could suggest the effect of the economic downturn in 200809 is beginning to reduce said mr abraham theres certainly more confidence within the housing market at the moment and an increasing amount of firsttimebuyers are now purchasing their own properties as a result of increased lending and mortgage availability recent reports suggest the build to rent scheme will improve the private rented sector by boosting the supply of buytolet homes within the market properties rented with longerterm tenancies as part of this scheme aim to not only offer additional security to tenants and their families but also curb spiralling rents recorded over the past few years,"number of elderly tenants increased in more than half of uks regions

0609bc5f971a58b7b955c4cd9ac71bc88a3de51b,most homeowners hit by flooding are faced with just two options  clean up and hope it doesnt happen again or move out but one determined couple whose island home was wrecked when the thames burst its banks last year have come up with a new idea  shifting their fivebedroom house 5ft into the air yaron ivry and his wife sigal have spent almost 80000 jacking  their riverside property in wraysbury berkshire up onto stilts and filling in the gap with breeze blocks yaron ivry and his wife sigal pictured together spent almost 80000 jacking their thameside property in wraysbury berkshire up by five feet to prevent it from a repeat of last years winter flooding here the house is seen in its finished state having been put on stilts and the new basement underneath the property bricked up  over the course of ten days a team of engineers lifted the 80ton building up into the air using a steel cradle and 28 computerised jacks which pushed the house upwards at a rate of three inches an hour now a year after the house was devastated by floods last january work is complete with the house protected from the waters of the thames and the ivry family enjoying a new basement underneath their home as well as a new kitchen replacing the one which was left underwater when the river breached its banks its fantastic mr ivry 59 told mailonline its great we are back in the house now and the work is almost all done there is still some work inside but its nearly there we have created a new basement under the house in the space where the stilts are and that will be useful for storage and we have a new kitchen it is better than we could have ever imagined with under floor heating and a better view out over the river mr ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift holes were bored into the brick walls shown here so supportive beams could put up both inside and outside the building  28 superstrong jacks  each capable of supporting 50 tons  were placed underneath the steel cradle a diamondedged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors severing the building from its foundations  every day i look out of the window and i smile and feel happy because i am safe mr ivry a former engineer and owner of telecommunications business dmobile his wife 49 their 17yearold daughter ayala and dog prince live on an island between the river thames and an artificial water channel which left them vulnerable to flooding when water poured into their home last january it caused 125000 in damage with the houses hardwood floor ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair as the rain poured down mr ivrys garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door he was unable to stop the water gushing in leaving the ground floor under nearly half a foot we are sitting on an island so when the water comes up it comes from all sides he said when we were flooded we were an island surrounded 360 degrees by water it was devastating the selfemployed couple lost a year of business because they could no longer work from their home mrs ivry who runs a jewellery distribution company said i was hoping right up until the last minute we would not have to move we thought maybe we could stay and live upstairs but after a day we realised it was not realistic when the smell starts the windows and walls of the home were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains and work began to lift the house slowly into the air  with the familys belongings still inside work to lift the house began after planning permission was granted last june  with the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the hydraulic jacks pictured no one part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was lifted from the ground at a rate of three inches an hour  the house became all humid and stinking  it was not healthy the value of the house  which had been worth 1 million  dropped to 750000 as it could not be insured against future floods now after the 80000 project the house is thought to be worth between 15 million and 2 million my view was that if i did nothing it would end up costing me and i would lose a lot of value on the house because i could not insure it he said but if i did something if i put in 80000 to save the house i would definitely get it back if i did decide to sell it plus i could insure the house and i could live in it safely fatherofthree mr ivry had considered sealing the house with a barrier waterproof doors and pumps to get rid of any ground water or leakage but worried that just one tiny crack would mean water pouring into his home again i could have spent 35000 and i wouldnt know if it would even work he said he also considered demolishing the house completely the value of the house  which had been worth 1 million  dropped to 750000 as it could not be insured against future floods now after the 80000 project the house is thought to be worth between 15 million and 2 million it took ten days to lift the house to its agreed height  it would have cost me maybe 400000 to rebuild it  and i would need to find somewhere else to live he said so i took up the challenge of lifting it and researching on the internet i saw that it had been done with a concert hall in shanghai people were sceptical and wanted to see if it would work but i knew that if it was done properly it then the risk would be almost nothing after getting permission from the local council mr ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift holes were bored into the brick walls and supportive beams put up both inside and outside the building then 28 superstrong jacks  each capable of supporting 50 tons  were placed underneath the steel cradle a diamondedged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors severing the building from its foundations with the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the jacks no single part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was raised finally all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains and work began to lift the house slowly into the air with the familys belongings still inside although they moved out into a rented flat nearby the newlyformed gap at the bottom of the house was then filled with breeze blocks and the steel cradle removed before the breeze block basement was concealed with reclaimed london yellow bricks designed to match the rest of the house mr ivrys newlyraised front door now has a long staircase leading up to it protecting the entrance to the house from any flood water  around the back of the familys house two former patio doors will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues the family were able to move back into their home in october  the couple say the transformation is unbelievable and their higher home means they enjoy a better view of the river  his front door now has a long staircase leading up to it and around the back of his house two former patio doors which are now suspended from mid air will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues work on the main structure was completed in august and the family were able to move back in

agency eager to learn from his project his neighbours many of whom were forced to leave their homes in last januarys floods have also turned to him for advice on how to protect their own homes from any future damage 2014 was total chaos said mr ivry i could not work by wife could not work and we were out of our home now 2014 is behind us and we are looking forward to the future we are so happy that we have done it and the house is unbelievable as the rain poured down mr ivrys garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door he was unable

035ef21dc1c4d949a248607c193900b493d2b711,new york cnna pair of new york police officers shot and wounded while responding to an armed robbery in the bronx were going offduty and probably not wearing their bulletproof vests police officials said tuesday in fact andrew dossi aliro pellerano and three other officers were changing clothes at the end of a dangerous anticrime detail when they ran out of a bronx station house to search for two robbery suspects officials said the suspects were arrested tuesday chances are they werent wearing their vests chief of department james oneill told reporters they were going home they jumped into a car and they ended up getting into this fierce firefight the alleged shooter was identified as jason polanco a 24yearold boxer who was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was said to have posted antipolice and antigovernment statements on social media police said his alleged accomplice joshua kemp 28 was arrested on robbery charges the wounded officers spent tuesday at st barnabas hospital in the bronx one of them dossi who is 30 and has eight years on the job was in stable condition following surgery after being shot in the arm and lower back according to police the other pellerano who is 38 and has nine years as an officer is in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and arm last night a team of our officers displayed extraordinary bravery going above and beyond the call to protect their fellow new yorkers mayor bill de blasio who has found himself at odds with some in his police force in recent weeks said in a statement tuesday  we thank these officers for their commitment to serving our city including answering the call after their shift had ended  this incident was yet another reminder of how profoundly important the work of our police officers is as well as the seriousness of the dangers they face every day in the line of duty de blasio also thanked new yorkers who provided more than two dozen tips that helped identify the gunman  police said 10 of the tipsters identified polanco by name monday night authorities located the white camaro that two suspects carjacked a block from the shooting as well as a 44caliber revolver but no one was inside the vehicle before polanco was arrested police offered a 12000 reward for information leading to a bearded man pictured in a surveillance video from inside a takeout chinese restaurant moments before the shooting police said he was the man who shot at the officers polanco entered the restaurant and bought a bottle of iced tea before coming out firing at the officers who stopped his alleged accomplice outside police said extraordinarily brave the call about an armed robbery at a bronx grocery store came in around 1030 pm monday as five plainclothes officers were coming off their shift rather than going home the police went to look for the criminals something de blasio described as extraordinarily brave and  part of their commitment the officers exchanged gunfire with polanco police said but the suspects got away fleeing on foot for one block and then carjacking the camaro at tense time for police in city  sometime after the shooting kemp checked himself into a manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back officials said the man who drove him to the hospital was also taken into custody kemp who has been arrested multiple times for robbery and was on parole gave an account of how he was shot that didnt add up police said he told a story that didnt seem factual to be honest with you robert boyce chief of detectives told reporters he was not credible  so quickly the story didnt add up and then we saw his background that he was a bronx guy and we started breaking the case the incident happened just south of fordham university an area hardly unfamiliar to violent crime john cardillo who patrolled the area when he was a police officer called it a rough neighborhood in the 90s and it still is today it had and has armed bad guys with the propensity to shoot someone the shootings have gotten heightened attention given when they happened  at a time of largescale antipolice protests after a grand jury decided not to indict a white new york police officer in the death of eric garner an africanamerican man even if its too early to tie it to this incident experts in the law enforcement community have expressed concerns that such sentiment  views supported in some respects according to some police by de blasio  will encourage violence against police thats what happened they say when ismaaiyl brinsley fatally ambushed nypd officers rafael ramos and wenjian liu last month as they sat in their patrol car when the rhetoric turns antipolice the police are concerned that people on the street its going to increase the already existent lack of respect in certain segments of the society  including armed robbers  and other violent criminals said cnn law enforcement analyst tom fuentes a former fbi assistant director de blasio has become a focal point for supporters of law enforcement with some police even turning their backs on him at ramos and lius funerals because of their perception that he has been overly supportive of protesters and critical of police the relationship is toxic and almost irretrievable in some respects cnn political commentator errol louis said of the mayorpolice dynamic this is not a good atmosphere on tuesday patrick lynch the president of the patrolmens benevolent association who has accused de blasio of having blood on his hands after the two officers were killed in december said in a statement new york city police officers who could have closed their lockers and gone home after their shift ended chose to respond to a robbery in progress and sadly were shot in the process our members are out there doing their jobs and putting themselves in danger to keep this city safe just as they always do

becker hewitt produced some inspired tennis to race through the opening two sets on rod laver arena against a player who had never won a fiveset match in his career however the former wimbledon champion was unable to maintain that level and becker  who admitted to kicking a door to let off some steam after leaving the court following the second set  roared back to secure a 26 16 63 64 62 victory in just over three hours veteran lleyton hewitt waves goodbye after crashing out of the australian open in melbourne  the former wimbledon champion would not confirm what his future now holds  australian tennis fans cheer on their fading hero at melbourne park  beckers win over andre agassi in the third round of the us open in 2006 prompted agassi to retire but the 33yearold german said i hope its not lleytons last match because then i get asked about it all the time he is a great warrior an unbelievable player so i hope he continues asked about his future plans hewitt  who won just one grand slam match in 2014  said ill sit down and think about it as ive said the whole time i havent thought about anything but obviously the davis cup is the next main thing now that weve got some guys playing really good tennis at the moment its an exciting time we have a good chance to possibly pull off an upset away against the czech republic in ostrava thats the next focus earlier in the day top seed and fourtime champion novak djokovic lost just five games as he cruised into the third round world no 1 djokovic thrashed russian andrey kuznetsov 60 61 64 in an hour and 24 minutes with all three singles matches on rod laver arena in the afternoon completed so quickly that a mens doubles match was hastily added to the day schedule the 33yearold australian raced to a two sets lead before blowing it against benjamin becker  hewitts wife bec was in the stands to watch what may be her husbands final match at the australian open  becker punches the air after completing a remarkable five set comeback  djokovic won the first nine games against a hopelessly outclassed kuznetsov who received a sympathetic cheer when he finally troubled the scorers in the fourth game of the second set the former wimbledon boys champion at least had the temerity to break djokovic at the start of the third but normal service was instantly resumed and djokovic closed out the match in ruthless fashion after my firstround match i was hoping to have this kind of performance especially the opening two sets djokovic said everything went as i planned and wished and hopefully i can stay on this path kuznetsov is a very talented player hes still young and hes of the generation of my younger brother marko who knows him well so i spoke to him because i had not seen kuznetsov play a lot djokovic has dropped just two sets over the first and second rounds since 2007 winning his first title at melbourne park in 2008 and lifting the trophy three years in succession from 2011 generally this is my most successful grand slam and the tournament where over the years ive performed my best tennis the 27yearold said the reason i think there is not one reason a few reasons together andre agassi cries as he announces his retirement after losing to becker at the 2006 us open  world no 1 novak djokovic breezed into the next round for the loss of just five games  russian andrey kuznetsov could not cope with djokovics superiority on centre court  probably the fact that i enjoy the conditions of play even though the last two years the courts have played faster significantly faster than they were before still i do enjoy being here in australia some nice positive easygoing sportoriented energy going around people appreciate the sport and make you feel good of course its the beginning of the year its the first big tournament everybody comes fresh and motivated i guess in this kind of package its a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here defending champion stan wawrinka who ended djokovics 25match unbeaten run here in the quarterfinals last year also safely reached the last 32 but needed two hours and 16 minutes to finally subdue the resistance of romanian qualifier marius copil the first two sets took longer to complete than djokovics entire match as they lasted an hour and 35 minutes with wawrinka winning both in tiebreaks before taking the third set 63 it was quite a tough match fourth seed wawrinka said im happy to get through especially in three sets djokovics coach and former australian open champ boris becker applauds his charge from the sidelines  defending champion stan wawrinka was forced to work before coming through againstqualifier marius copil  the conditions werent easy today quite hot really fast on the court and he was playing great he was serving big putting lots of pressure i wasnt playing my best tennis but im happy the way i fight today and the way i did with the match im happy with my game in general to win the two first matches in three sets its great im playing great tennis as i say if you want to get far in the tournament it can be two long weeks so you need to be ready to have some ups and downs so far its been good tennis im happy wawrinka will face jarkko nieminen in the third round after the finn defeated german qualifier matthias bachinger in straight sets with fifth seed kei nishikori

george for the first time at st marys hospital in london has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations  the agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family so it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess carole middleton  mother of the duchess of cambridge  sought the advice of those valued by other great british families  even those that dont actually exist downton abbey has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile mrs middleton set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding the family even went to highclere castle the set for itvs award winning period drama to meet etiquette expert historian alastair bruce who advises the show on social protocol they were so delighted by the royal equerrys knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the royal wedding in april 2011 mr bruce 53 is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate affectionately nicknamed the oracle he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the wrong shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the downton dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table a source told the sun alastair is also a queens herald so he has a lot of experience but im sure people will be amused to know the middletons looked to downton abbey for help in coming up with the coat of arms although as a royal bride kate would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right it was decided that her parents would commission one how it might have been had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the middleton crest might have turned out  a highclass lineup the cast of the popular show downton abbey  painstaking process after much discussion about the design herald painter robert parsons sketches the coat of arms for the middleton family  coats of arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use taking up responsibility for the control of their useover time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in societythe college of arms a branch of the royal household is the official body in the uk that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts  funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money  design and research heraldic or genealogical issuesthe arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of armshowever that doesnt mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms the cumulative knowledge of the earl marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people dont proceed with their applicationthe late peter gwynnjones a former garter king of arms once said in practice eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission a sound university degree or professional qualification or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole this gives his entire family  including their other children pippa 30 and james 26 the right to use the emblem they met with mr bruce and his colleague thomas woodcock the college of arms garter principle king of arms and senior herald to invent their crest together they settled on a simple design with three leafy acorns representing each of the couples three children  an idea suggested by kate herself acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks oak is also a symbol of england and strength and west berkshire where the children were brought up has many oak trees most eyecatching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing kates mother carole at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name goldsmith the two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the familys love of skiing and outdoor pursuits the background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the united kingdom and match prince williams recently revised coat of arms the college of arms also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words middle tone but while kates brother james will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children pippa as a woman will not and can only use it during her lifetime yesterday a spokesman for downton abbey confirmed alastair worked with the garter principal king of arms on developing the middleton crest royal wedding programme prince williams coat of arms was printed on the front while kates designed in complimentary colours decorated the back,"downton adviser alastair bruce helped middletons come up with the design

076f488be801ae3c4ff30a48c4fd55e3fd1b5d4f,new york cnn  its a historic event taking place on an international stage thats been seven years and 40 billion in the making the national stadium known as the birds nest is shrouded in smog on opening day of the 2008 olympics opening ceremonies last week of the 2008 olympic summer games were lauded as the most spectacular in history with pyrotechnics blasting from the top of beijing chinas national stadium and a synchronized fireworks display firing off across the capital what has been mostly absent from beijing however are protests although a unified china is the image that countrys government is eager to portray many human rights groups allege that china has orchestrated a massive coverup beyond human rights questions remain about whether china has kept its promises to the world to improve in two other major areas of reform freedom of the press and pollution cleanup human rights  in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony  that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers said sam zarifi asiapacific director for amnesty international in its report the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown  broken promises amnesty international details what it calls a systematic persecution of dissident voices in beijing and throughout china the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called reeducation through labor zarifi said what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson  and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up the amnesty report cites other human rights violations leading up to the olympics amnesty accuses the chinese government of using surveillance and detention to pursue family members of activists and blocking protesters from traveling to the capital city from other areas such as chinas sichuan province which was devastated by an earthquake in may that claimed the lives of nearly 70000 people the chinese foreign ministry criticized the amnesy international report saying it had a biased attitude toward china ministry spokesman liu jianchao was quoted by china daily in a news briefing saying we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way beijing secured the olympics in 2001 amid some controversy with a tacit acknowledgment of concerns over its record on human rights press freedom and environmental pollution even the day before the host city was announced wang wei then secretary general of the beijing olympic bid committee said china was committed to change we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights wang said we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china press freedom  however it was quite a different story for reporters as they arrived at the olympic press center in beijing they discovered that many web sites had been blocked such as those with information about tiananmen square protests tibet taiwan or the dalai lama internet sites are severely regulated throughout china and limited access to some of the sites was granted only after reporters complained to the ioc the same official who assured the international media of complete freedom in 2001 took a somewhat different tone last week yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people said wang who is now the executive vice president of beijings olympic organizing committee in a statement provided to the associated press wang said as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations  however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games critics of chinas policy on a free press said the problems run much deeper than the lack of access to some web sites from the olympic village chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable  this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists said xiao qiang director of the china internet project at the university of california berkeley china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened foreign journalists in china for the olympics complain that access to report on anything that extends beyond sporting events has been severely limited xiao points to the recent beating and detention of two japanese journalists who were investigating an alleged terrorist attack in northwestern china as a sign of a government that is not used to a free press they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior xiao said chinese officials later apologized for the beating incident pollution  a third major commitment by china in its olympic bid was to clean up pollution in beijing although government readings on pollution have gone down in the years since china won the bid they still routinely far exceed world health organization guidelines and at least one americanbased environmental consultant believes that china has purposely manipulated its own pollution statistics to give a false impression that more progress has been made beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign said steven q andrews author of a scientific report on chinas air quality and two opinioneditorials on the topic for the asian edition of the wall street journal andrews cites the closure of two air quality monitoring stations in heavily trafficked areas of beijing in 2006 as the reason why the number of blue sky days increased in the past two years the blue sky program was instituted by the governments in major cities across china as a system to measure acceptable levels of pollution the criteria for a blue sky day are still below what many industrialized countries consider good air quality when the program was launched in 1998 beijing had only 100 blue sky days but last year that figure rose to 246 a report the chinese state media hailed as a major improvement when asked about the allegations that air quality monitoring stations were shut down du shaozhong the deputy head of the beijing environmental protection bureau said this phenomenon does not exist according to time magazine chinese officials did not respond to cnns request for an interview despite official assurances that the air is safe for competition athletes and fans have expressed concern over the thick smog covering the entire city the american lung association went so far as to issue a warning to those attending the games individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing  and limit or avoid outdoor exercise it said beyond highlighting the discrepancies between chinas promises and actual reform critics interviewed by cnn about all three major areas shared one common sentiment disappointment this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people  a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world said amnesty internationals zarifi,"china has spent 40 billion seven years planning for 2008 olympic games 
in 2001 china promised to improve human rights press freedom and pollution

trainers  the sort youd find in any sports shop on the high street but the truth is theres nothing standard about this pair of shoes specially commissioned for pop star beyonce made from a combination of crocodile anaconda stingray and ostrich skin as well as calfskin its little wonder that everyone from animal rights groups to the singers fans has branded her cruel and spoilt for making such a tacky and exploitative fashion statement beyonces trainers are based on a wedgestyle shoe by designer isabel marant but have been given a bling makeover by american company perfectly made kicks pmk unique the handcrafted sneakers are custommade for beyonce using a mix of stingray ostrich calfs fur crocodile and anaconda skins  the company which states that their exotic skins come from a legal supplier in new york previously customised a pair of trainers for beyonces rapper husband jay z that were covered in calf ostrich python boa constrictor crocodile lizard alligator and stingray skins as well as patches of imitation elephant skin pmk boss andre scott says its legal i dont think animal rights campaigners like it very much but its legal legal or not animal lovers are outraged that beyonce has followed in her husbands footsteps pmk  insists no animals were beaten harmed or killed in the development  and crafting of the sneakers  though it remains slightly unclear how  you make a shoe out of any kind of leather without killing animals expensive taste beyonce often wear these 62000 goldplated balenciaga leggings on stage  the pressure group peta people for the ethical treatment of animals is in no doubt these custommade trainers come with a high price  and its paid by the various animals who were beaten and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed here the mail reveals how these exotic creatures suffer  in the name of high fashion anaconda  with its interlocking scales the skin used for the detailing over the heel and toe of beyonces trainers is immediately identifiable as snake anacondas like crocodiles are subject to controls by the convention on international trade of endangered species cites but the trade is so poorly regulated that it is difficult to establish the source of the skins for every animal that goes through the system legally it is estimated that another will be smuggled excessive hunting of the snakes   which are found in south america and can grow to a length of 20 ft   poses a threat to the viability of the species in the longterm there  are also widespread concerns about the barbaric ways in which snakes  captured in the wild are killed as  skins are valued at 23 a foot designer tom ford sells his  overtheknee anaconda boots for 2000 great care is taken to ensure  it is removed undamaged from the snake the creature will often first be  stunned with a blow to the head rather than killed outright in  order to loosen the skin a hose pipe is inserted into its jaws and the  snake filled up with water swelling the reptile up like a balloon it  will be left like that for ten minutes or so a leather cord tied around  its neck to prevent the liquid escaping then  its head is impaled on a meat hook a couple of quick incisions follow  and the loosened skin is peeled off with a series of brutal tugs  much  like a rubber glove being removed from a hand from  there the skin will be sent to a tannery before being turned into  luxury shoes or handbags because of the snakes slow metabolic rate it  can survive skinned alive for hours or even days until succumbing to  the effects of dehydration or shock ostrich  the ostrich skin that forms the tongue of beyonces shoe is one of the strongest commercial leathers and bears the distinctive pattern of bumps made by the quill follicles of the birds feathers while ostriches were originally farmed in south africa for their feathers and meat their leather became popular in the us during the seventies when it was used for cowboy boots since then it has become a firm fashion favourite  the hides fetch more than 320 each british bag designer mulberry sells ostrich leather totes for up to 4500 while the classic louis vuitton keepall 50 bag in ostrich skin costs 7000 skinned the team behind the sneakers used ostrich skin for the tongue of the shoes and anaconda for the heel and toes detailing to please beyonce  critics of ostrich farming point out that in the wild the birds have welldeveloped courtship nestbuilding and chickrearing behaviours and live to 50 or more farmed they are penned up their eggs taken away from them and their chicks killed at little more than a year old wild ostriches can run at up to 40mph and will cover 15 to 20 miles a day in their natural habitat but farmed ostriches are often confined to an acre or less of land as a result they are prone to painful leg deformities and suffer from other diseases such as avian flu animal rights campaigners have also highlighted the stress ostriches endure during slaughter the birds legs are tied together and a watersoaked hood placed over its head it is then electrocuted hoisted upside down and its throat cut as it bleeds to death crocodile  farmed around the world crocodile skin is so popular that 13 million of the reptiles are slaughtered to meet demand each year beyonce has a fourinch strip of crocodile skin on the back of her trainers crocodiles are favoured by shoe and bag designers a grey crocodile hermes birkin costing 79000 is one of many such bags owned by the socialite tamara ecclestone the majority of crocodiles killed for their skin are bred and reared on farms but every year more than 90000 are also killed in the wild fierce fang beoynces sneakers have a fourinch strip of crocodile hide on the back  a further 225000 are ranched this is where they are monitored in their natural environments and then brought on to farms for slaughter animal rights campaigners say the crowded pens in which the reptiles are kept cause great stress they are unable to swim away to quiet areas as they would in the wild there is no mud for them to lie in or grass to hide in their natural instincts to hunt are denied and they develop abnormalities and deformities because they cant walk or swim after just three years their short lives come to a brutal end  the usual method of killing will be a bullet the crocodiles are grabbed by workers and their snouts bound before being dispatched with a rifle a direct shot to the brain which is encased in a 2cmthick skull is far from guaranteed while this might seem a callous end to a short life for an animal that would live for 70 years or more in the wild it is more humane than the method used on some farms according to peta the reptile can be killed by hammering a chisel between the base of the skull and the first vertebrae a procedure which can take between five and eight blows to achieve they are then skinned often while still alive like snakes because of their slow metabolisms they can survive in agony for up to two hours after they have been completely skinned only certain bits of the skin will be considered good enough to use which means it can take up to four crocodiles to make one bag as a result of the intensive hunting of wild crocodiles they are supposedly protected under the cites agreement raw hide stingray skin is 25 times more durable than cow hide and is worth 63 per square foot  stingray  famed for being 25 times more durable than cowhide stingray leather  often referred to as shagreen  is used on the three fastenings on beyonces trainers traditionally the rays which are closely related to sharks would have been killed for food the skins a by product used for the grips of chinese and japanese swords in recent years the leather has become a popular material in the world of high fashion  alexander wangs stingray purses sell for 800 because the skins are relatively small they tend to be used for purses and wallets rather than bags the skin is worth 63 per square foot while the fish are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters their populations are increasingly under threat five species of stingray are listed as endangered and there is a worrying lack of data about the population levels of many others it is estimated that in indonesia alone two million rays are caught each year with some boats bringing in up to 30 metric tons of stingrays per trip because stingrays reach maturity relatively late and produce relatively few offspring there is concern that overfishing could cause populations to collapse last year in response to this threat panama banned fishing for stingrays in its territorial waters scientists have warned that unless steps are taken on an international level to significantly reduce the catch of these animals they are

event in london on october 29  lena dunham is reportedly threatening to sue the rightwing website which last week accused her of sexually abusing her little sister grace when they were children in the wake of the allegations  the creator and star of hbos girls has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in belgium and germany for health issues on monday  she tweeted that she was deeply sorry to miss the antwerp book fair and a signing in berlin adding that shes so grateful for your energy and support last week rightwing website truth revolt excerpted a portion from lenas new book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it unsettling and disturbing today that website claims that lena is threatening to sue them if they dont remove the article she claims is false and defamatory and publish an apology note the website adamantly declined and editor ben shapiro wrote another article explaining why they would not heed to the demands of lenas lawyers we refuse we refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it because quoting a womans book does not constitute a false story even if she is a prominent actress and leftwing activist lena dunham may not like our interpretation of her book but unfortunately for her and her attorneys she wrote that book  and the first amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like the article reads the passage that truth revolt excerpted details a conversation that thenyearold lena had with her mother famed artist laurie simmons about womens organs in the course of the conversation young lena asks her mother if little sister graces vagina looks like hers i guess so just smaller her mother responds  one day as i sat in our driveway in long island playing with blocks and buckets my curiosity got the best of me dunham writes  scroll down for video  allegations a rightwing website published a story last week citing an incident detailed in lenas right new book as evidence of molestation the essay descirbes a curious 7yearold lena looking at her then 1yearold sister graces left vagina after having a conversation with her mother about female reproductive organs the dunham sisters pictured above at the filming of lenas film tiny furniture in november 2010  grace was sitting up babbling and smiling and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina she didnt resist and when i saw what was inside i shrieked my mother came running mama mama grace has something in there my mother didnt bother asking why i had opened graces vagina this was within the spectrum of things i did she just on her knees and looked for herself it quickly became apparent that grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there my mother removed them patiently while grace cackled thrilled that her prank had been a success truth revolt  responded described the essay as unsettling and disturbing in an article titled  lena dunham describes sexually abusing her little sister the article reads lena dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister grace whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using anything a sexual predator might do in one particularly unsettling passage dunham experimented with her sixyear younger sisters vagina they also originally wrote that dunham was 17 at the time of the incident and later added a correction saying this article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing dunhams age as seventeen obviously upset with being named as a child molester dunham took to twitter on saturday to lash out at truth revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published the website has refused to apologize for the article if ms dunham says that our quotations from her book were false or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law then we look forward to asking her in her deposition about why they appeared in her book editor ben shapiro wrote on tuesday we also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28yearold woman to make light of opening her baby sisters vagina paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a sexual predator or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister he added grace dunham also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own twitter rant on monday writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered normal behavior grace writes that she supports writers narrating their own experiences determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful she also posted 2day like every other day is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women queer and trans people while the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sisters essay they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world the sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the truth revolt article according to one tweet lena wrote on saturday sometimes i get so mad i burn write up also i wish my sister wasnt laughing so hard dunham tweeted on november 1 in defense grace dunham left came out to respond to claims her older sister sexually abused her when they were children the sisters pictured above in a snap posted to lenas instagram last year,"the girls

body blow but there was a moment in the afternoon when it seemed like not much had roughly 200 credentialed media were gathered in a far corner of the indianola balloon field the grassy expanse where sen tom harkin was convening his 37th and final steak fry an annual fundraiser that doubles as a point of entry for ambitious democrats curious about the iowa caucuses after a 90minute wait the press scrum  scribblers and photographers alike  were herded like cattle through a series of gates and escorted up to a hot smoking grill waiting to capture the same image a staged shot of bill and hillary clinton fresh out of their motorcade ritualistically flipping steaks with harkin hillary clinton stumps for iowa democrats and herself  the clintons ignored the halfhearted shouted questions from reporters  mr president do you eat meat  with practiced ease they were two football fields away from the nearest voter mechanical distant heavyhanded the afternoon spectacle felt a lot like hillarys 2008 caucus campaign a succession of errors that crumbled under the weight of a feuding topheavy staff and the candidates inability to connect with her partys grassroots and then the head fake  and something different after a few minutes the clintons walked into a nearby barn out of view most of the media swarm gave up and hustled back to the main event where nearly 7000 democrats were eating red meat and waiting patiently in the sunshine to hear from two of the most famous people in the world a few dozen press were still milling about when the duo reemerged there she is a television reporter screamed clamoring for her cameraman an early moment of engagement  there she was bill too walking along a fence and gabbing with a small army of political reporters a chore that has never come easy for hillary clinton and one she has assiduously avoided since leaving the state department its hardly a shock that the voluble expresident handled a rope line full of reporters with gusto but the willingness of the more reticent hillary clinton to thrust herself into the gaping maw of the hungry press dragon signaled perhaps that she and her aides are eager for a fresh start in iowa and with the national media if she runs for president once again she kept both the state and the press at arms length during her last campaign with troublesome consequences on sunday though she gave it a go  an early moment of engagement with the media and voters that revealed an understanding of past mistakes but also the difficult road ahead if she takes the 2016 plunge good to see you she told the assembled press surely a halftruth my goodness you guys having a good time good were having a good time today strutting back and forth clinton declared that it was fabulous to be back in the state i love iowa she said smiling as if she were in on a joke she entertained and swatted away a bombardment of questions mostly of the unremarkable will you run variety does this whet your appetite for another campaign asked one reporter were here to help democrats clinton responded offering requisite praise for iowas democratic candidates senate hopeful bruce braley gubernatorial challenger jack hatch and congressional candidate staci appel this longawaited interaction so craved by the accessstarved political press was shortlived never quite at ease in these situations clinton milled about for five minutes or so keeping a few feet between herself and the press before walking back into the secure barn the other clinton  now he likes to talk  bill clinton meanwhile was having at it holding court with reporters for a good 20 minutes  much of it with msnbc host ed schultz  while his wife the presumed candidateinwaiting was nowhere in sight bill sidled up with harkin and held forth with the press on all manner of topics the 92 campaign the prospect of being a grandparent the scourge of outside money in political campaigns the arkansas and georgia governors races a recent visit to atlanta after their futile yelps of last question and we gotta go were ignored over and over again aides finally dragged the former president away then it was time to meet the voters hillary clintons speech to the sundrenched crowd more workmanlike than impassioned was littered with iowa pleasantries and nods to the last campaign including her opening line hello iowa im back she lavished praise on harkin and after a warmup that included nods to her time as secretary of state and her constant grandchild watch urged the audience to get behind iowas slate of democratic candidates her biggest applause lines were about womens issues  equal pay and abortion rights  a departure from the 2008 race in which she avoided focusing on her gender and the historymaking nature of candidacy the crowd was firmly in her corner thanks in large part to the super pac ready for hillary which plastered every nook and cranny of the rural setting with ready signs and bused in an army of volunteers to collect email addresses and phone numbers from arriving democrats bill clinton laughingly called the young organizers energizer bunnies leading in the polls but  she leads the early polls here by a wide margin but there is still fault to be found with clinton among iowa democrats conversations reveal that some of them skew more liberal than clinton on economic and foreign policy issues others want a fresh face and see the 66yearold clinton as an avatar of the past and there are those who just say theyd like to see a competitive race for the sake of the process even if clinton ultimately wins the nomination maryland gov martin omalley has been welcomed warmly during his three visits to the state this year sen bernie sanders a vermont socialist threatening to seek the nomination also

wonderful sue laplante a certified nursing assistant from des moines said after the speech if she runs she will be the next president hillary was a good candidate last time but sometimes its what fate throws at you and barack obama was making history said irene hardisty a 61year old mortgage finance specialist from des moines this time she will make history everyone here  operative activist politician reporter  has a theory about why clinton finished third in iowa in 2008 and there are no shortages of bright ideas about how she can perform better in 2016 but there is universal agreement from rankandfile democrats that clinton has to touch and feel iowans listen to them talk oneonone and get outside the security and media bubble that surrounds her everywhere she goes she gave that a go too working the rope line after her speech for half an hour in the baking sun signing copies of hard choices awkwardly posing for selfies and saying thank you to the many people demanding she run for president it wasnt a perfect show at times as her secret service detail and her aide huma abedin escorted her along the crowd she looked like shed rather be elsewhere she ignored questions from notsofriendly crowd members who wanted her to comment on the presidents immigration policy recovery funds for superstorm sandy or the israelipalestinian conflict then it was back to the motorcade but

06ee2326ddc286c4610c36e53b68f66dfaffe498,beijing cnn  i was at the last public speech by the former us ambassador to china gary locke during the q  a session a chinese student asked the outgoing ambassador to compare the chinese dream and the american dream the ambassador said he didnt know much about the chinese dream so he talked instead about the american dream like americans the chinese people also have their dreams  a powerful country a good education a happy family or a bountiful harvest yet the dreams of the ordinary chinese have never been articulated as powerfully and eloquently as the american dream until xi jinping came into power opinion chinas awkward banana slip  xi first mentioned the term the chinese dream during his tour of an exhibit at the national museum of china in november 2012 shortly after he became leader of the chinese communist party that exhibit is called the road to national rejuvenation and xi said the chinese dream is the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation then on march 17 2013 xi fully spelled out his thoughts about the chinese dream in his first public speech as the newly elected president of china the chinese dream is the dream of the whole nation as well as of every individual he said the chinese dream after all is the dream of the people we must realize it by closely depending on the people and we must incessantly bring benefits to the people publicity campaign  after his speech the chinese dream has entered the daily discourse of both the chinese government and the ordinary chinese thanks in no small part to the governments massive publicity campaign there were countless speeches contests essay competitions scholarly conferences and tv shows that had the chinese dream as the central theme if there had been a contest for the most popular chinese phrase in 2013 the chinese dreams would probably have won the title apart from nationwide publicity there are other reasons why the chinese dream has become a household phrase it is much less elusive than mao zedongs thoughts deng xiaopings theories jiang zemins three represents or hu jintaos harmonious society it is a term that can be understood by any chinese besides who doesnt have dreams thus it easily resonates with the chinese people finally xi promised to realize the dream by depending more on the people and bringing more benefits to them thus xis dream at least in its rhetorical form is a dream for the people by the people and of the people who doesnt like such a dream reforms  and xi meant what he said at least in one area and that is corruption the most urgent issue facing the chinese community party he has launched an unprecedented crackdown on corruption and 20 highranking officials  viceminister level and above  have been investigated or punished within a little more than year he also signed two documents  eight regulations and six bans  that have significantly improved bureaucratic efficiency and sharply reduced public expenses on receptions overseas travel and vehicle purchases because of xis tough campaign chinas entertainment businesses particularly topend restaurants clubs and hotels have suffered enormous losses over which the ordinary chinese are rightfully gloating rampant corruption be it bribery buying and selling offices illegal land grabs or abuse of power is certainly the biggest scourge of china today leading to rising discontent and unrest as well as declining public trust in government most importantly corruption seems to have made it increasingly difficult for the ordinary chinese to have their dreams come true restoring confidence  china is becoming economically and militarily much more powerful and the average chinese is living a much better life yet at the same time more and more chinese seem to have lost faith in the government and the future of china a prosperous and powerful china should be a land of opportunities for its people but actually it appears to have become a land of anger and despair for an increasing number of chinese thus xis articulation of the chinese dream and his campaign against corruption can be viewed as the first steps by the new chinese leadership to restore public confidence in the party and the government thus far his policies have won enthusiastic support among most chinese and xi has become arguably the most popular leader since deng xiaoping if the dreams of the ordinary chinese today  like those of their ancestors in ancient china  depend on the good luck of having a sage leader however that means china is still under the rule of man not rule of law when that leader steps down or if that leader makes disastrous decisions the dreams of the chinese people will be in jeopardy with immense popular support at the moment president xi should initiate institutional reforms that empower every chinese to have dreams and to have those dreams come true these reforms will not only set china on a path of sustainable political and economic development but also enable the chinese people to be truly proud of the chinese dream just as americans are proud of the american dream the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of tao xie,"march 14 marks one year since xi jinping was officially appointed chinas president 
after xis first presidential speech the chinese dream became a household phrase 
xis campaign against corruption can be seen as the first steps to restore public trust says xie 
xie says reforms will enable all people in china to be truly proud of the chinese dream"

liked he had to know he was misleading the audience kerrey said quietly recalling the newly minted presidents countless promises as congress and the public debated his signature health insurance overhaul not your typical democrat former nebraska sen bob kerrey opened up with mailonline about his disappointments with his party and his president  if you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan kerrey says many politicians suffer from selfdelusion that makes it easier to lie to the public  on the other hand he may have said it so many times he added that the spellchecker wasnt in the room  the spellchecker the factchecker  somebody who says excuse me mr president but i hope you know this obamas infamous fourpinocchio pledges kerrey explained never stood a chance of being fulfilled because there were a million people out there with policies that for one reason or another run short of the minimum standard i mean they bought something cheaper the white house understood the numbers kerrey said and republicans did a poor job of explaining the basics of the insurance industry to lowinformation voters insurers he said the gop could have made clear make money by not paying claims and by making sure that 80 per cent of the people that are buying insurance dont need it  so i need young people to sign up thats what its all about the worst lie democrats told about obamacare kerrey reasoned is not if you want to keep your health care plan  the worst one is everybody deserves highquality affordable health care excuse me uh i dont know if youve heard about the bell curve he snarked if ive got 1000 doctors 100 are great and 100 are not so good he outlined the shape of a bell curve with his hands and then threw them skyward its absolutely impossible he said and affordable forget about it kerry is best known for calling former sen rick santorum an hole in the philadelphia inquirer and for calling bill clinton an unusually good liar kerry has kept his oar in foreign policy helming the new school for many years in new york city where he rubbed elbows with foreign leaders like german chancellor angela merkel l when the affordable care act met its most vigorous republican opposition in late 2009 the us economy was still floundering and the business communitys eyes were focused on gdp growth not a new set of healthbenefit mandates i wouldnt have done health care kerrey saidi think the big mistake was  to say whew weve got the stimulus done okay the economys going to come bouncing back in 12 months  lets do health care he explained only the economy didnt come bouncing back were teetering on the edge of going  out of business through most of 2009 kerrey recalled and i think  you need to just keep driving driving driving on the economy and make  it as bipartisan as possible lifelong pol in 1992 thensen kerry made an ultimately failed bid for the democratic presidential nomination that eventually went to bill clinton  obama compounded his rhetorical mistakes with political ones he said by agreeing to ditch a proposal allowing americans to buy into the medicare system the way they would buy a policy from a private insurer and now you want to do health care kerrey imagined democratic pols telling obama near the end of his first year in office its okay youre going to do health care i havent talked you out of it mr president but dont give on the public option even if the obamacare law had died in congress he insisted the politics of holding fast to the public option would have favored democrats since medicare is among the federal governments most universally popular programs i would have been much better off campaigning saying my opponent does not want you to have the right to buy into medicare kerrey mused in his washington dc days the former nebraska governor often stood out as the rare democrat who publicly lamented us entitlement programs seemingly unstoppable march to insolvency were robbing from the future to pay for the past he told mailonline on wednesday we just are and were shoveling more and more money to people over the age of 65 a  lack of political will and a healthy dose of electoral fear he said  has virtually guaranteed a climate inside the us capitol where no one  will take the first step toward cutting benefits or ratcheting up the  national retirement age its the one thing rs and ds can agree on kerrey explained dont screw with seniors kerrey is a decorated navy seal veteran who has grappled with issues of conscience he once acknowledged that a vietnam combat mission for which he was awarded the bronze star caused the deaths of 13 to 20 unarmed civilians most of them women and children  the result he said is a set of financial chains clamped tightly on future generations during an illfated 2012 run to recapture his old senate seat kerrey  totaled up uncle sams spending on medicare social security and the longterm care portion of medicaid and divided it by the number of americans in the work force all workers he insisted including government workers and the source of their contribution is entirely tax money but take all of it the cost he determined is 15000 per year per worker once a politician  kerrey tried to win back his old senate seat in 2012 only to be beaten in the primary by deb fischer who ultimately won the general election  asked how to break the congressional logjam kerrey thought for a moment and said softly it takes a president it takes a president is barack obama that president kerrey stayed silent but shook his head im shaking my head no he acknowledged finally if he was up to it he would have done it he cant run for reelection another of obamas failings according to kerrey is an inflated sense of americans appetite for programs to correct what the white house calls income inequality through new taxes and other incomeshifting initiatives that transfer wealth from the rich to the poor the presidents reelection 17 months ago wasnt a mandate to conduct class warfare he said after the 2012 election what the president needed was somebody to say mr president im thrilled you won you stand for all the things i support but honestly you won this election because you sucked less than romney americans kerrey believes lost patience equally with the gop and the white house during the kabuki theater of fiscal cliff congressional super committee budget sequester and tense partial government shutdown obama stuck to his guns at the time holding out for a balanced budgetgap fix that included new taxes on upperincome americans everybody since 1913 has had a mandate to raise taxes on the rich kerrey scoffed at his partys leader this isnt something that youve earned something thats unique coplorful as governor of nebraska kerrey dated actress debra winger for more than two years telling reporters that she swept me off my foot he lost part of one leg in the vietnam war obama isnt the first president to make that kind of miscalculation  kerrey calls it selfdelusion  while in office he joked that geneticists will one day soon find a base pair of genes that predisposes people to deception and he predicted halfseriously that theyll find another base pair which say that politicians have 25 per cent more capacity for  you call it lying i call it selfdelusion bill clinton kerrey once famously hinted may have been that genetic traits darwinian ideal hes an unusually good liar unusually good the nebraskan said in 1994 he told mailonline that he actually intended it as a compliment although clinton didnt take it that way obamas lies he said stem from the same human flaw that selfdelusion moment comes in a single declaratory sentence kerrey said which is if they just get to know me theyll vote for me its just selfdelusion  some of us are good at it and some of us are bad,"kerrey a twoterm senator in the 80s and 90s is disappointed in the president for risking the health of the us economy over obamacare 
he had to know he was misleading the audience he said of obamas infamous if you like your health care plan deception 
explains that an even bigger lie democrats tell is that everybody can get highquality affordable health care
obama he says lacks the courage to bring democrats and republicans together to save us entitlement programs from bankruptcy 
if he was up to it he would have done it kerrey tells mailonline"

account for millions of pounds in wasted public money a leaked list seen by the mail on sunday shows the metropolitan police has signed deals worth 35 billion with more than 300 companies to supply everything from hightech weaponry to sandwiches the huge sums will be scrutinised when met commissioner bernard hoganhowe appears before a powerful group of mps on tuesday with scotland yard under

horse manure  full details of the mets spending with private firms spanning more than a decade and with some contracts ongoing reveal the force is paying out  keith vaz the chairman of the home affairs select committee said this is the first time that we have received such a comprehensive list about the expenditure of a  police force we will be exploring some of the expenditure with the commissioner when he appears before the committee on tuesday joanne mccartney chairwoman of the london assemblys police and crime committee said i think procurement at the met does need to be looked at we have raised issues with the mets spending on dog kennelling before its it costs have been looked at before i think the budget needs to be tightened otherwise it will mean fewer police officers being employedjenny jones the deputy chair of the police and crime committee said police officers tell me they see waste all the time at the met aiming high the force spent 211million on weapons and armour  they tell me it costs the met 100 just to put a whiteboard up in their office the police officers say they get angry because it means bobbies on the beat are cut back there is waste at every level of the organisation with national responsibility for counterterrorism and protecting vips as well as keeping londoners safe the met currently has 31548 officers a further 2738 police community

and introduce smarter procurement at an organisation he described as an enormous beast mr greenhalgh told the home affairs select committee in september that he was staggered by how much the force spends on it it also employs 802 inhouse computer maintenance staff because counterterrorism officers are worried about the security risks of using outside external contractors mr greenhalgh said the met did  not need a plethora of expensive buildings and spent a staggering 200 million on running them last month the force announced plans to sell its new scotland  yard headquarters famous for its revolving sign in an attempt to  save money the reassuring presence of police stations across london is also under threat with proposals to replace them with counters inside supermarkets and cafes the

00e87dec09d988e3c457ae44c318c79fe7160de8,washington cnn  the supreme court voiced deep free speech concerns tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute the justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decadeold statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals but media groups and the national rifle association were among those who say the law is overly broad its not up to the government to decide what are peoples worst instincts said justice antonin scalia one can contemplate a lot of other areas where government could say you are appealing to peoples worst instincts and therefore movies cannot be made showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused for example what about people who like to see human sacrifices asked justice samuel alito somewhat sarcastically suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world i mean people here would probably love to see it live payperview you know on the human sacrifice channel they have a point of view they want to express thats okay he seemed to indicate strongly it was not and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it the specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations watch an excerpt of the tapes   a federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of robert stevens a pittsville virginia man who sold videos through his dogs of velvet and steel business according to court records undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in sporting dog journal an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting among the products stevens advertised was catch dogs featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig according to the philadelphia pennsylvaniabased appeals court stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty he was later sentenced to 37 months in prison and promptly appealed he argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player michael vick who ran an illegal dogfighting ring it was the first prosecution in the united states to proceed to trial under the 1999 law the divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals several media organizations have come out in support of stevens worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting and depictions of bullfighting in ernest hemingway novels a number of justices too had concerns raising a number of hypotheticals a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated why not do a simpler thing suggested justice stephen breyer rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean ask congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit now that can be done you have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited said chief justice john roberts how can you tell these arent political videos with organizations like peta people for the ethical treatment of animals and others depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it why arent these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it justice sonia sotomayor questioned the distinction between stevens videos and news items tell me what the difference is between these videos and filmmaker david romas documentary on pit bulls i mean david romas documentary had much much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here greater sections of the film and more explicit she said romas 2006 independent film off the chain consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage among the wideranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included fox hunts pate de foie gras from geese cock fighting bullfighting shooting deer out of season even roman gladiator battles neal katyal an attorney for the justice department said the law was narrowly targeted and had exceptions specifically for religious political scientific educational journalistic historical or artistic value this statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message it has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty said katyal justice samuel alito appeared most supportive of the governments views he asked about selling of socalled crush videos in which women  with their faces unseen  are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spikedheel shoes or with their bare feet the people who produce crush videos think they have a message and the message is that this is sexually exciting he said clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter when stevens lawyer patricia millett launched into a caveatladen answer alito broke in you are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited he asked because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad and this is the category of activity that congress particularly targeted congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of crush videos the humane society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed millett said congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the first amendment area she noted that if the law is upheld it would only be the second time the supreme court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the first amendment the justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography the problem in this case was that congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our constitution upside down millett told reporters later the government had argued a compelling interest in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions the case is us vs stevens 08769 and a ruling is expected in several months,"the justices heard an hour of debate about scope and intent of decadeold statute

of the tailpipe of my 2002 chrysler sebring with 90000 miles is this a big problem i have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine what should i do  sally new york  sally generally engines burn oil due to a few reasons bad valve seals worn valve guides pressurized crankcase oil pan due to a clogged pcv valve or breather system and blowby from worn piston rings bad valve seals the valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber oil is pumped at 40 to 80 psi poundssquare inch of pressure into the top of the head lubricating the valvetrain the valves have seals to stop the flow of oil down into the engine when the valve is open if the seals fail then oil is allowed to flow down into the combustion chamber and is burned worn valve guides a small cylindrical chamber called a valve guide does just what its name says  it guides the valves these guides wear out over time causing eccentricity slop the excess gap that forms allows oil to flow down the valve stem into the combustion chamber to be burned normally the valve seal stops this flow however in this case the gap is too great for the seal to work aol autos should you use synthetic motor oil pressurized crankcase due to clogged pcv or breather system your cars engine is a giant air pump consequently it must breathe the pcv positive crankcase ventilation system allows the engine to exhaust the excess pressure buildup which is a natural phenomenon of the internal combustion engine carbon is a byproduct of an engine and can build up in the pcv system clogging the breathing passages this in turn pressurizes the oil pan and pushes oil up into the fuel delivery system where it is fed into the engine and burned aol autos do i need to replace my air filter blowby from worn piston rings the pistons in your cars engine have seals around them in the form of rings these rings have two functions 1 they seal the combustion chamber so that the power developed from the firing of the cylinder is not lost 2 they provide vital lubrication to the cylinder walls when the rings wear out the pressure from combustion reverses down into the oil pan pressurizing it and forcing oil into the valve covers from there it goes through the breather system back into the fuel delivery system and into the engine to be burned i have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine is this a big problem its hard to say without performing some diagnostics on the engine a quart of oil a week is excessive it could be due to a plugged pcv or excessive internal engine wear take the car into the shop for engine diagnostics my guess is that the tech will perform a compression test along with a cylinder leak down test after heshe determines if the pcv system is open during these tests the tech tries to determine if there is loss of engine compression blowby or excessive oil consumption due to ring wear if excessive ring wear is discovered then further engine teardown will be necessary to determine if the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced aol autos how often should you change your oil  what is the difference between blue and white smoke the engine can emit different colors of smoke  blue smoke blue typically means that engine oil is being burned in the combustion chamber in rare cases when a vehicle is equipped with a transmission that uses a device called a vacuum modulator valve to soften shifts between gears according to engine vacuum the diaphragm can break inside the valve and cause transmission fluid to be sucked into the engine via the vacuum line feeding the valve and burn aol autos fluid leaks unsafe and expensive  white smoke white can mean one of two things 1 water condensation from a blown and leaking head gasket this gasket is the seal between the cylinder head and engine block water runs through channels called water jackets that line the cylinder walls and thus carry away heat when the head gasket blows the seal between the cylinder head and engine block breaks and water is allowed to enter the combustion chamber this water is emitted from the engine in the form of water vapor or steam and it is white in color 2 excessive gas fuel delivery systems sometimes falter and dump excessive amounts of raw fuel into the intake plenum when this happens the amount of fuel is too much for the engine to process hence it exits the engine and tailpipe in the form of pure white fuel vapor it stinks like raw gas and can be dangerous if it ignites in the hot muffler and catalytic converter i have witnessed exhaust systems literally blown off the vehicle from the explosion that ensued from ignition of a gasfilled catalytic converter this condition must be fixed immediately to prevent internal engine damage or worse yet a serious fire can i add oil or coolant and keep driving the vehicle until i can afford to fix it yes however be advised that such maladies never get better by themselves and they always get worse with time there is a real possibility that you will get caught on the road driving at highway speeds thinking you added enough oil transmission fluid or engine coolant and the oil runs out causing a catastrophic failure in general when it comes to a need for auto repair conditions never improve on their own you must maintain your vehicle if you want to get the maximum life out of it and in the long run spend the least amount of money aol autos how to avoid common car problems,"an oilthirsty engine and smoke coming from cars tailpipe are signs of trouble

07d505ba2225dfcdfda018866e082c769987f642,washington cnn  house speaker john boehners plan to raise the nations debt ceiling and slash government spending narrowly passed his chamber on friday and then was blocked by senate democrats setting up a weekend of negotiations to seek a deal that would avoid a potential federal default next week the senate vote was 5941 to table the measure which effectively kills it unless democrats decide to bring it up again earlier boehners proposal was approved by the house in a sharply polarized 218210 vote that was delayed by a day while the speaker rounded up support from wary tea party conservatives no democrats supported the measure and 22 of the 240 members of the republican majority also opposed it even though it was blocked in the senate the boehner plan now is the republican negotiating position for hammering out a deal with congressional democrats and president barack obama to avert a possible government default next week however no facetoface talks were scheduled with democrats accusing senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of refusing to negotiate and mcconnell in turn seeking a chance for his caucus to reject a proposal offered by senate democratic leader harry reid as a vehicle for compromise democratic and republican sources familiar with the situation told cnn that mcconnell insists the white house be present in further negotiations toward a debt ceiling deal in a continuation of the political theater that has characterized the negotiations so far the house scheduled a vote on the reid plan for saturday  before the senate will even begin considering it  as what appeared to be payback for the rejection by senate democrats of the boehner proposal reid meanwhile said the senate will likely vote to take up his plan at 1 am sunday et as part of the procedural path required to get something passed in coming days as the political maneuvering continues the clock continues to tick down if congress fails to raise the current 143 trillion debt ceiling by august 2 americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar among other problems some financial experts have warned of a downgrade of americas triplea credit rating and a potential stock market plunge the dow jones industrial average dropped for a sixth straight day on friday without an increase in the debt limit the federal government will not be able to pay all its bills next month obama recently indicated he cant guarantee social security checks will be mailed out on time defense secretary leon panetta issued a statement friday to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work next week as scheduled regardless of whether a deal gets worked out panetta pledged to do everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected a department of defense official told cnn on condition of not being identified that on the possibility of military pay being withheld its not a question of whether but when if an agreement isnt reached fridays house vote was a critical test of boehners control over his tea partyinfused gop caucus the speaker was forced to quell a rightwing revolt over the measure after a number of members complained that it doesnt do enough to shrink the size of government and stem the tide of washingtons red ink boehner rohio managed to sway several of those members by including a provision requiring congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution before the debt ceiling can be extended through the end of 2012 in his floor speech before the vote boehner called the proposal imperfect but necessary and he criticized obama and congressional democrats for rejecting all deficit reduction measures passed by the house so far weve tried to do our level best  but some people continue to say no boehner said adding i stuck my neck out a mile to try to get an agreement with the president of the united states his voice rising to a shout boehner continued to cheers and applause from fellow republicans it is time for this administration and the other party across the aisle  put something on the table tell us where you are democratic leaders vehemently object both to the balanced budget amendment and the requirement of a second debt ceiling vote before the next election they argue that reaching bipartisan agreement on another debt ceiling hike during an election year could be nearly impossible and that shortterm extensions of the limit could further destabilize the economy earlier in the day obama urged senate democrats and republicans to take the lead in the congressional deliberations boehners plan has no chance of becoming law obama said the time for putting party first is over the time for compromise on behalf of the american people is now  its important for everybody to step up and show the leadership that the american people expect this is not a situation where the two parties are miles apart the president insisted but we are almost out of time obama urged americans to contact their members of congress to keep the pressure on washington phone lines on capitol hill were jammed friday as people from coast to coast tried to weigh in on the debate meanwhile reid dnevada has been pushing his own plan to raise the debt limit though he will need to win over at least seven senate republicans to win the 60 votes necessary to overcome a certain filibuster reid announced friday morning that he intended to take action on a senate bill by the end of the day later he complained on the senate floor that republicans would effectively filibuster his proposal by requiring a 60vote supermajority in the 100member chamber to support the start of debate on it it was unclear when reid would attempt to hold that vote and he warned it could as late as 1 am et sunday reid also blasted boehners decision to include a mandatory balanced budget amendment provision in the gop plan calling the addition of even more stuff in this rightwing leaning bill  its really hard to comprehend sen chuck schumer dnew york accused boehner of adding all kinds of unrealistic poison pills to his plan but mcconnell rkentucky argued senate democrats were doing little to actually resolve the crisis i would suggest to my friends on the other side  that they start taking their responsibilities as a majority party a little more seriously because at this point the only people who are disregarding the consequences of default are senate democrats  not the republicans in the house  but them mcconnell said in a statement after the house vote mcconnell said i eagerly await the majority leaders plan for preventing this crisis leaders of both parties now agree that any deal to raise the debt ceiling should include longterm spending reductions to help control spiraling deficits but they differ sharply on both the nature and timetable of the cuts despite the strong partisan rhetoric there have been signs of a growing recognition of a need for further compromise earlier this week mcconnell called for renewed negotiations with obama and indicated that his party must be willing to move away from some of its demands sources close to the negotiations have also told cnn that vice president joe biden is very much in the mix of backchannel conversations on a possible fallback position white house chief of staff bill daley told cnn thursday that presuming the boehner plan wins house approval and gets blocked in the senate the next step is for everyone to take a step back in the congress and look at where is a point of compromise daley said that similarities between the boehner and reid plans may be the grounds for a deal that hopefully both parties can pass both plans suffered setbacks earlier this week when the nonpartisan congressional budget office released reports concluding that they fell short of their stated deficit reduction goals boehners plan which has since been revised proposed generating a total of 917 billion in savings while initially raising the debt ceiling by 900 billion the speaker has pledged to match any debt ceiling hike with dollarfordollar spending cuts his plan however would require a second vote by congress to raise the debt ceiling by a combined 25 trillion  enough to last through the end of 2012 it would create a special congressional committee to recommend additional savings of 16 trillion or more any failure on the part of congress to enact mandated spending reductions or abide by new spending caps would trigger automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts the plan as amended friday also calls for congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution before the second vote to raise the debt ceiling which would likely be required at some point during the winter as for reids plan a revised version he proposed friday would reduce deficits over the next decade by 24 trillion and raise the debt ceiling by a similar amount it includes 1 trillion in savings based on the planned us withdrawals from military engagements in afghanistan and iraq reids plan also would establish a congressional committee made up of 12 house and senate members to consider additional options for debt reduction the committees proposals would be guaranteed by a senate vote with no amendments by the end of the year in addition it incorporates a process based on proposal by mcconnell that would give obama the authority to raise the debt ceiling in two steps while providing congress the opportunity to vote its disapproval among other things reid has stressed that his plan meets the key gop demand for no additional taxes boehner however argued this week that reids plan fails to tackle popular entitlement programs such as medicare which are among the biggest drivers of the debt a recent cnnorc international poll reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise sixtyfour percent of respondents to a july 1820 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases only 34 preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions according to the poll the public is sharply divided along partisan lines democrats and independents are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a major crisis for the country republicans however draw the line at tax increases and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances cnns ted barrett kate bolduan gloria borger keating holland brianna keilar

1 2012 after the couple had returned to the home they shared in warwickshire following a new years eve party mann then dumped motheroffour ms oconnors body in her ford focus and drove it around for two days before parking it outside his  parents home and telling them what he had done evil killer aaron mann left 33 strangled his girlfriend claire oconnor right 38 to death after a new years eve party then tried to hide her body  the 38yearolds body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her car on january 2 last year mann told a court voices in his head told him to kill his lover and denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility but he was sentenced to life in prison today after being found guilty of murder yesterday following a weeklong trial warwick crown court heard how he had previously sent his girlfriend chilling death threats one which read you aint going to be around for long and another that said simply i will kill you mann was told he must service a minimum of 16 years in court today domestic violence the body of the motheroffour was discovered wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her ford focus on january 2 last year  his victims heartbroken parents graham and patricia griffiths said after the sentencing they had been in no doubt that mann was guilty of the savage and brutal murder of our daughter we would like to thank the jury who have seen through the lies and deceit of aaron mann in his attempt to minimise his responsibility for the brutal murder of our daughter claire the couple said in a statement issued through warwickshire police his suggestion that voices told him to do it were in our opinion completely fabricated claire had decided to split up from mann but she was murdered before she had a chance to leave him we  have had to live with the terrible consequence of manns murder of our  daughter the details of which have been both shocking and graphic at  no stage has mann shown any remorse whatsoever and his account of how  he murdered claire is quite the worst thing any parent could possibly  imagine at least we now know  that while he is in prison other parents can know that their daughters  will not be exposed to this evil killer ms oconnors son daniel wrote on facebook following yesterdays verdict its a result but dont bring her back rot in hell scene forensic investigators descended on the couples home in nuneaton warwickshire in the wake of ms oconnors murder in the early hours of new years day last year  difficult bouncer mann was convicted of murder and told he must serve at least 16 years in prison following a weeklong trial  detective chief inspector james essex from warwickshire police said the force was pleased with the outcome of the trial this has been a particularly difficult trial for claires family and friends he said unfortunately domestic abuse is largely a hidden crime that all too often takes place behind closed doors often no one other than those directly involved know it is taking place sadly it is too late for claire but i am urging anyone who suffers from domestic abuse in whatever form be it physical psychological sexual financial or emotional to seek help from the police or other support agencies the message to anyone affected by domestic abuse is that you do not have to put up with the abuse and you dont have to cope on your own there are people who can help people who can listen and who can provide you with support the court heard throughout the trial how mann was driven to jealousy after seeing ms oconnor socialising with other people and she had told him their relationship was over mark wall qc prosecuting said the attack occurred on january 1 after the pair returned from a pub called the green bear near their home in nuneaton mr wall said they returned home at around 1230am and mann killed claire by applying such force to her neck as to asphyxiate her a pathologist found other injuries as a result of the attack including a broken jaw and two broken ribs there can be no doubt that what mann did was a significant attack which was intended to either kill her or cause her very serious injury mr wall added that the pairs relationship had not run smooth and that the previous spring ms oconnor had gone to the police to report violence and threats against her by mann giving evidence to the court himself mann  who had already admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility  demonstrated how he had gripped her neck and put a pillow over her face he added the voices told me to finish her off prosecution psychiatrists dismissed manns claims he had an acute psychotic illness  finding he had been perfectly rational and careful in trying to cover his tracks manns medical records  which included frequent visits to doctors and psychiatrists since 2009  had made no mention of hearing voices,"aaron mann 33 broke claire oconnors jaw and two of her ribs

photographs scott krafft holds up a daguerreotype of a dead child from the mid 18th century mr krafft said they may have been the only photograph of the child that existed  we  are very removed from death today and a lot of this stuff we see in  this collection gives us a snapshot in how people have dealt with death  generations ago in ways very different from today said benn joseph a  manuscript librarian at the school we look at it nowadays and think  this is inappropriate or gory but when it was done it was very much  acceptable mr joseph and others spent months getting the 76box collection  one containing a childs coffin  ready to be studied the archive which officials said  ultimately will go on public display includes at least one artifact  dating to the 16th century a spanish painting of a dead boy his eyes  closed wearing a cloak with a ruffled collar the school bought the collection from mcdowells partner director laurence senelick for an undisclosed price mcdowells younger brother james said he didnt realize but wasnt surprised by the extent of the collection he always had kind of a gothic horror side to him mr mcdowell said in an interview there are photographs and postcards from around the world one taken in 1899 in cuba shows a pile of skulls and bones in another a soldier in the philippines poses with a mans severed head there also are reminders of the infamous photographs show the people convicted of conspiracy for abraham lincolns assassination being hanged with dozens of soldiers looking on and the us capitol looming in the background some pictures are gruesome including  one of a man whose legs are on one side of the train tracks and the  rest of him in the middle but much of the collection is devoted to the  deaths of regular  americans and how they were memorialized in the 19th and early 20th centuries there  are for example dozens of photographs that families had made into  postcards of their dead children dressed in their finest clothes many  appear to be sleeping some have their eyes open serious looks on their  faces hair mr mcdowell also collected pins and brooches containing locks of dead peoples hair the badges are worn by women after the death of a loved one  macabre books and adverts are also among the collection pictured here is the championship book on embalming  collection scott krafft left

books joseph said it could  be a bit of photographic sleight of hand and that the boy may actually  be lying down but made to look like he is standing with the advent of photography regular folks could have access to that sort of thing and families either took the kids body to the studio or they arranged for a visit from the photographer said scott krafft the library curator who purchased the collection for northwestern and they may have been the only photograph of the child that existed the collection also offers a glimpse into what families did after their loved ones died at a time when they were preparing their homes to display the remains and getting ready to bring them to the cemetery after choosing a burial gown  worn in ads by living models  many families then looked for a headstone traveling headstone salesmen in the early 20th century often carried around design samples in a box about the size of one that holds chocolates those paying their respects in the 19th and early 20th centuries frequently selected a tribute song for the dead to play inside the family homes mr joseph said there were some 100 popular pieces of topical sheet music with such titles as she

while the collection isnt yet on display members of the public can see one piece when they enter the library reading room where it is housed that childrens coffin that once belonged to mcdowell now

06c7ebdcc58e41b68278c77d140916f986dce37c,on a cold monday in february 2012 46yearold merseyside police officer mike cawson became a tragic statistic  one of hundreds of nhs patients injured or killed each year when medical devices fail pc cawson who was suffering from heart failure was being rushed by ambulance from royal liverpool university hospital for lifesaving surgery in a specialist cardiac unit at manchesters wythenshawe hospital he never made it his failing heart was relying on a special pump  a portable version of an intraaortic balloon pump inserted into his main artery in 2013 there were 13600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra  these were linked to 309 deaths and 5000 serious injuries  such pumps which inflate and deflate a balloon in the artery are used as temporary support for the heart in patients who are awaiting urgent cardiac surgery but halfway through the 40mile drive to the hospital where the specialist team was on standby to perform an emergency operation the battery powering his pump failed internal hospital documents obtained by good health reveal that the battery which had been fully charged before the ambulance journey was faulty with no spare battery on board the transfer team from the royal liverpool were helpless and the ambulance was forced to divert to nearby warrington hospital where the balloon had to be removed an inactive balloon can quickly cause blood clots to form later that day pc cawson was sent on to his original destination but died the following day an inquest into his death heard from a consultant cardiologist from the wythenshawe who said it was highly unlikely that the failure of the pump had contributed to pc cawsons death the royal liverpool also reiterated to good health that its patient had experienced no clinical adverse effects but had sadly died after a sudden deterioration in his condition there is no doubt however that the failure of the pump did mean that pc cawson was not able to have the lifesaving surgery he was meant to have furthermore after his death the trust issued advice to all teams transferring patients with intraaortic balloon pumps to carry a spare battery it can be of no consolation to pc cawsons loved ones to learn that many other families lives have also been shattered when medical equipment failed patients the official figures for the number of nhs patients injured or killed each year by faulty medical equipment are shocking in 2013 there were 13600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra  these were linked to 309 deaths and 5000 serious injuries the numbers are rising over the past decade there have been almost 100000 reports of failed devices involving 2300 deaths and 22000 injuries its difficult to shake the impression that medical devices are being rushed onto the market  but these official figures could be just a fraction of the true human cost of unreliable medical equipment for in a stunning admission to good health the mhra says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad its experts have told us that based on global research and work carried out following the scandal over the pip breast implants which were made using industrial silicone with a high risk of rupture they believe reporting of such incidents to be less than 20 per cent of the real figure and possibly as low as 10 per cent if this is true this would mean in 2013 there were actually a shocking 68000 adverse incidents with 25000 injuries and 1545 deaths applied to the past decade this produces a shocking tally that almost beggars belief almost 500000 incidents 11500 deaths and 110000 serious injuries asked if it would be reasonable to extrapolate the figures in this way tony sant the watchdogs manager responsible for adverse incident reporting and medical devices said theres nothing new with that kind of analysis the question is of those incidents were the serious ones reported there was he adds no way of knowing one of the reasons for this is an extraordinary culture of secrecy embedded in eu law under article 20 of the 1993 medical devices directive all the parties involved in the application of this directive are bound to observe confidentiality with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks in other words the mhra cant breathe a word we cant give you which trusts and which medical device manufacturers were involved explains mr sant we are prohibited thats why the mhra never named the manufacturer in an earlier death linked to a failed battery in an intraaortic balloon pump yet these two incidents were neither the first nor the last time this type of device has failed on march 24 last year maquet a division of swedish medical technology giant getinge urgently recalled more than 12000 of its intraaortic balloon pumps it had received more than 100 reports that a simple design fault  a misshapen ring  was causing the device to shut down without any visual or audible warning this could result in a sudden and potentially fatal loss of blood pressure a patient died as a result getinge issued a previous urgent recall for the same device in 2010 when it discovered the screens indicating the pumps performance tended to go blank kornelia rasmussen the communications manager for getinge told the mail our products by their very nature are used in lifethreatening and critical care environments countless times each day if we believe that any are not safe or do not meet our specifications we institute immediate corrective action and we will continue to do so getinge is not alone each year the mhra receives approximately 1000 safety notices from manufacturers alerting the watchdog to problems with their products yet while the mhra is not allowed to name the manufacturers it was able to reveal that the most frequent failures have been in expensive hightech equipment being used in critical situations such as operations and in intensive care the mhra is also allowed to name names and products when a reported failing could have widespread safety implications issuing a medical device alert the mhra has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients  but here too the figures are far from reassuring in 2014 49 such alerts were issued the most recent was on december 18 warning of a risk of serious injury to babies in an infant warmer made by fisher  paykel healthcare a faulty retaining nut meant the heater unit may partially detach in the past year device manufacturers including some of the biggest names have issued close to 1000 socalled field safety notices they make for hairraising reading at one end of the scale was a wheelchair that might suddenly tip its seat backwards and an instrument for orthopaedic surgery so badly designed that it couldnt be cleaned properly exposing patients to the risk of infection more obviously lifethreatening were faulty defibrillators which are increasingly in the hands of inexperienced community volunteers last year the mhra issued an alert for one smart defibrillator which advised lifesavers to use too slow a rate of chest compression another defibrillator incorrectly displayed a do not touch the patient icon  which according to the mhras masterful understatement could affect patient outcome grave faults were also highlighted in pumps that automatically administer drugs to patients a ventilator used to aid breathing during surgery and a software program for analysing ct scans the number of european patent applications for medical devices doubled between 2002 and 2012 outstripping applications from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors there are already 500000 different types of medical devices being used in the nhs and its difficult to shake the impression that these devices are being rushed onto the market insufficiently tried and tested this is reinforced by the shocking number of times the mhra has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients in 2013 alone manufacturers were ordered to give 1129 undertakings to improve designs manufacturing processes and quality systems and between 2011 and 2013 production ceased on 143 products said a spokesman partly or wholly because of mhra intervention or because a company felt it didnt want to make the necessary changes for commercial reasons the mhra is prevented from telling us which ones a spokesman for the association of british healthcare industries abhi rejected any suggestion products were being rushed out saying they were put onto the market with processes backing them up to ensure they meet the correct standards furthermore monitoring the products after theyve been launched enables manufacturers to learn lessons from any field reports  if there is a situation identified by mhra or others where improvements need to be made then manufacturers will respond to that the number of reports of faulty medical devices involving new joints  and this is perhaps the most shocking thing of all for the regulation of medical devices is a bit like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted under eu law private companies known as notified bodies assess medical devices for quality safety and check that they work they then hand out the ce mark allowing these devices to be marketed in europe thereafter postmarket surveillance  essentially waiting to see if something goes wrong  is used to identify any problems in other words everyone from the manufacturers to the mhra and the notified bodies seems to accept that device failures are inevitable  with patients serving as guinea pigs the mhra says it is working urgently with nhs england to eradicate the problem of underreporting in the meantime following the mhra experts revelations to good health the watchdog now says that its investigations have whittled down the number of deaths associated with device failures in its most recent official report from 309 to just 86 it is an extraordinary uturn on its own published official figures there is no doubt that the system is fundamentally  and potentially dangerously  flawed two things are certain says peter walsh chief executive of the patient charity action against medical accidents far too many people are needlessly dying or being harmed as a result of faulty devices or poor use of devices and the reported incidents are still an understatement of how big the problem is what we do know is clearly just the tip of the iceberg,"over past decade there have been almost 100000 reports of failed devices 
this involved 2300 deaths and 22000 injuries but could be just a fraction 
the mhra says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad 
most frequent failures have been in expensive hightech equipment"
02019342943a34cb078cc80c4d7b45153327298f,around three to seven per cent of children or 400000 are believed to have adhd in the uk picture posed by model more children  and adults  than ever are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd yet many of those may not have the behavioural disorder but could instead be suffering from sleep deprivation says a leading us doctor he estimates more than a third of children and a quarter of adults diagnosed with adhd actually have sleep problems sleep deprivation especially in children does not  as might be expected  cause lethargy but very similar problems to adhd including hyperactivity an inability to focus aggression and forgetfulness the similarity between the symptoms coupled with many doctors poor understanding of sleep disorders is what is causing the confusion in some patients says vatsal thakkar a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the new york university school of medicine while there is no doubt that many people have adhd a substantial proportion of cases are really sleep disorders in disguise he says adhd is characterised by problems with attention concentration and impulsiveness around 5 per cent of british children are thought to be affected with prescriptions for drugs to treat them rising by 70  per cent between 2005 and 2011 prescriptions for ritalin the most popular drug for adhd have quadrupled in the past decade with children as young as three taking the powerful medication adhd is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of three and seven and is four times more common in boys than girls in around half of cases the disorder continues into adult life but now some experts are questioning whether the real problem is poor quality sleep numerous studies have shown that many children with adhd also have breathing problems during sleep such as snoring and apnoea  where breathing becomes slow or interrupted by the muscles and soft tissue in the throat collapsing causing a blockage  and are more likely to have disrupted delta sleep this is the deep rejuvenating kind which starts about 30 to 50 minutes after we fall asleep children need delta sleep for proper growth and development one study published in 2004 in the journal sleep looked at 34 children with adhd every one showed a deficit of delta sleep compared with only a handful of the 32 children in the study who didnt have the disorder meanwhile a study of more than 11000 british children published last year found those who suffered breathing problems during sleep in infancy were more likely to have behavioural difficulties later in life no off button the distraction of 24hour tv computer games and mobile phones is a major factor in child sleep deprivation  these children were 20 to 60 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems at the age of four and 40 to 100 per cent more likely to have such problems at seven tellingly when sleep problems are resolved the behavioural problems attributed to adhd can disappear a study published in the journal paediatrics in 2006 found that removing tonsils to improve sleep seems to banish adhd symptoms a year after the surgery half of the children who had previously been diagnosed with adhd no longer had it professor thakkars theory is supported by british sleep experts who say it is no coincidence that the rise in adhd diagnoses in the nineties came at a time when people were getting less sleep the latest figures suggest that the number of adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night has risen from 2 per cent in 1960 to more than 35 per cent in 2011 according to dr neil stanley a british sleep expert children today get at least an hour less sleep than they did 100 years ago many tenyearolds do not get the recommended ten hours a night the distraction of 24hour tv computer games and mobile phones is a major factor because they not only stimulate the mind but suppress levels of melatonin a hormone that helps to regulate sleeping and waking cycles the lightsensitive cells at the back of the eye are more sensitive to the light emitted by screens  which tricks the body into thinking that its still daytime so it disrupts the production of melatonin ask any parent to describe a sleepdeprived child and the characteristics are not dissimilar to adhd he says some children do have adhd but others are sleepdeprived and we are calling it adhd some perfectly normal children who for whatever reason are chronically sleepdeprived are being diagnosed with adhd by their gps many doctors also  have very little knowledge of  sleep disorders sleepea children some perfectly normal children who for whatever reason are chronically sleepdeprived are being diagnosed with adhd more controversial is his belief that it may also be easier for doctors to tell parents their child has a medical condition rather than that he or she needs more sleep with the parenting implications that involves for some children it may be a diagnosis of convenience yet by misdiagnosing sleepdeprived patients as having adhd we are not only doing a disservice to those who really have adhd but may be treating thousands of patients with poor sleep with medications designed to control or modify daytime behaviour furthermore drugs for treating adhd can have sideeffects including poor appetite stomach pain and in rare cases heart problems chest pain liver problems and suicidal thoughts professor thakkars interest in the link between adhd and sleep disorders was prompted by his own experience after being diagnosed with adhd as an adult for nearly a decade he suffered from profound cognitive lethargy and difficulty focusing  he needed a daily nap and spent much of the weekend sleeping initially he was told that the problems were the result of psychological issues then in 2005 he was diagnosed with adhd not convinced he underwent a sleep study which showed at the age of 33 that he had an unusual form of narcolepsy a neurological disorder which usually causes intermittent uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep id never fallen asleep while eating or talking but it turned out that just 5 per cent of my sleep was delta sleep with the proper treatment my cognitive problems came to an end my daytime focus is remarkably improved professor thakkar says there is more going on in our nocturnal lives than we realised however it is impossible to know how well you sleep unless you undergo tests  thats because sleep is partly biological and partly behavioural he says even if parents and children do all the right things to make sure they get enough sleep they may be getting too little quality sleep limiting time on devices especially in the evenings is a good first step for children with these types of symptoms if that doesnt work parents should ensure that their child gets enough sleep for their age ten to 11 hours for schoolage children seven to eight for adults if that does not help seek medical help and consider undergoing a sleep study,"sleep deprivation in children causes similar effects as adhd 
some experts think kids diagnosed with adhd really suffer from bad sleep 
children get much less and poorer quality sleep now than they used to"

from home family work and school have been excused while a few were dismissed for expressing opinions about the defendant most were let go after revealing compelling hardship issues during questioning by the judge and lawyers from both sides one woman in her 50s who works at a hospice said she cannot go weeks without an income her employer would not compensate her during the trial and she said she would not be able to pay her mortgage another woman said she is in school and would have no one to care for her 4yearold daughter the obstacles to serving represent a vivid crosssection of everyday struggles for americans especially in a fragile economic recovery financial difficulties chronic illness single parents trying to care for children while earning a living were among the excuses offered in court the judge in the case belvin perry previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial perry wants to shield the panel of 12 and eight alternates from media coverage of the trial and other factors that could sway the outcome blacks law dictionary defines jury sequestration as the custodial isolation of a trial jury to prevent tampering and exposure to publicity other major cases that have been sequestered in recent years include the oj simpson double murder trial in los angeles and the trial of mary winkler found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in

potential jurors who expressed opinions about the case during voir dire questioning to ensure jurors are not biased the old french phrase means to speak the truth jury selection is scheduled to resume wednesday morning belvin dismissed a panel of candidates on tuesday saying they were contaminated by a prospective juror overheard discussing the case by sheer coincidence the juror is a witness in the anthony case and was serving in pinellas county after screening for hardship the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty in a moment of limited levity on tuesday belvin asked one potential juror who planned to visit savannah georgia with his wife in june for their wedding anniversary whether he would be in the dog house if the trip were put on hold i think shed be a bit more upset than i would at this point he said,"casey anthony case indicates

06b9f5177aacd34cc88a169200831fb396d5a348,washington cnn  president obama began to flesh out the details of one of his signature campaign promises tuesday outlining his plan for a major overhaul of the countrys education system from the cradle up through a career president obama says the decline of education is unacceptable for our children we have let our grades slip our schools crumble our teacher quality fall short and other nations outpace us obama said in an address to the us hispanic chamber of commerce the time for fingerpointing is over the time for holding ourselves accountable is here the relative decline of american education is untenable for our economy unsustainable for our democracy and unacceptable for our children and we cannot afford to let it continue he said the president outlined a fivetier reform plan starting with increased investments in early childhood initiatives obama noted that the recently passed 787 billion stimulus plan includes an additional 5 billion for head start a program to help lowincome families he highlighted a proposal to offer 55000 firsttime parents regular visits from trained nurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and life he also pledged to boost federal support in the form of early learning challenge grants to states that develop plans to strengthen early education programs second obama called for an end to what has become a race to the bottom in our schools through lower testing standards echoing former president bushs call to end the soft bigotry of low expectations obama said states needed to stop lowballing expectations for students  watch obama challenge states to raise their standards   the solution to low test scores is not lower standards its tougher clearer standards he argued at the same time however he urged states to develop standards that dont simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble on a test but whether they possess 21st century skills like problemsolving and critical thinking entrepreneurship and creativity to help promote this goal obama said he would push for funding in the no child left behind law to be more effectively tied to results the education department he said would back up this commitment to higher standards with a fund to invest in innovation in our school districts obamas third tier focused on teacher training and recruitment he noted that federal dollars had been set aside in the stimulus plan to help prevent teacher layoffs he also reiterated a promise to support merit pay as well as extra pay for math and science teachers with the goal of ending a shortage in both of those subjects at the same time however the president warned that ineffective teachers should not be allowed to remain on the job if a teacher is given a chance but still does not improve there is no excuse for that person to continue teaching he said i reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences teachers unions have opposed meritbased pay arguing that it is unfair because it leads to competition among teachers and because teachers face different challenges depending on where they are located fourth obama called for the promotion of educational innovation and excellence by renewing his campaign pledge to support charter schools he called on states to lift caps on the number of allowable charter schools he also urged a longer school calendar i know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas obama said but the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom obamas final reform initiative focused on higher education among other things the president promised to boost college access by raising the maximum pell grant award to 5550 a year and indexing it above inflation he also promised to push for a 2500 a year tuition tax credit for students from working families the american federation of teachers a union with 14 million members said tuesday that it embraces obamas goals to provide all americans with a comprehensive competitive education that begins in early childhood and extends through their careers we also fully support the presidents call for shared responsibility for education  among public officials school administrators parents students and teachers the group said in a statement as with any public policy the devil is in the details and it is important that teachers voices are heard as we implement the presidents vision in promoting his program the president called for an end to the partisanship and petty bickering that many observers believe has typically defined education policy debates in the past we need to move beyond the worn fights of the 20th century if we are going to succeed in the 21st century he said obama also offered a rebuttal to critics who have accused him of diverting attention to issues such as education and energy at the expense of the deteriorating economy i know there are some who believe we can only handle one challenge at a time he said but we dont have the luxury of choosing between getting our economy moving now and rebuilding it over the long term cnns kristi keck

newspoll commissioned by the australian newspaper finding that more than 68 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance worse the newspoll figures revealed mr turnbull was by far the preferred liberal party leader with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing mr abbott on a twoparty preferred basis labor led the coalition by 14 points 57 points to 43 the poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a prime minister in more than 20 years comparable only to paul keating in 1994 mr abbott began today with a visit to a canberra church it

the most critical tests of his leadership in the form of a spill motion this morning  tony abbott and his family spent time in sydneys china town on sunday afternoon after he had announced the spill motion would take place in canberra on monday  tony abbott claims he has moved the spill motion forward because the last thing australia needs right now is instability however others believe he made the decision to avoid an awkward question time on monday  senior liberal figure arthur sinodinos has said he is very disappointed by prime minister tony abbotts decision to move the spill motion forward to monday and revealed he will vote in favour of a spill  the most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was liberal senator arthur sinodinos the former chief of staff to prime minister john howard i believe it will help precipitate a discussion senator sinodinos told fairfax media on sunday he said he was very disappointed with the prime ministers decision to move the spill forward from tuesday to monday he said mps should be given time to discuss the matter at hand tuesday is the time to do that treasurer joe hockey has said any cabinet minister who supports the liberal leadership spill motion should resign mr hockey said he expected all cabinet members to reject the spill motion but if they supported it they should declare their hand now if i disagreed with the prime minister and if i believed he wasnt the best person to lead the team i would step down from the cabinet  that is the appropriate thing to do he told sky news on sunday he said he trusted his cabinet colleagues malcolm turnbull and julie bishop if you are going to be disloyal to someone you should front them mr hockey said he expected the motion would be voted down but not unanimously there will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another he said the treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill i think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the australian people not engage in commentary on gossip mr hockey stood by the governments controversial decisions to overhaul medicare higher education pensions and welfare which have contributed to the leadership unrest we have no choice he said of the budget changes queensland mp wyatt roy 24 has also declared that he will vote in favour of the motion to spill the leadership of the government wyatt left is pictured with abbott in 2010  communications minister malcolm turnbull welcomed foreign minister julie bishop to sydney on sunday  mr turnbull has only voiced his opposition to mr abbott moving the vote forward labelling it a captains call  what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions including knighting prince philip mr turnbull said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal if for whatever reason the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand whether they be a minister or a backbencher without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant he said outside his home on sunday on sunday mr abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line as quickly as possible so the liberal party can put the matter behind them the only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister he said now obviously ive been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do  to clean up labors mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve turnbull has refused to deny he will challenge the prime minister for leadership of the liberal party and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant  malcolm turnbull refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports mr abbott in line with cabinet solidarity  as prime minister tony abbott battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next weeks leadership spill motion a new galaxy poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters  want him to stand down  as reports that  malcolm turnbull will contest the leadership continue to circulate the poll showed he would improve the liberals chance of winning at the next election if he were made prime minister  foreign minister julie bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against mr abbott but still not as much as a labor government according to the 5347 twoparty preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot  there may be some hope yet for mr abbott as sources reveal mr turnbull would offer him his support  on tuesday if he were to be promised the role of treasurer dumping joe hockey pictured from the position  the communications minister took to twitter this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader julie bishop  he also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so

02539361c1e59708933aba0f3a22e9c5f6bc9b3f,us health officials on tuesday released a draft of longawaited federal guidelines on circumcision saying medical evidence supports having the procedure done and health insurers should pay for it the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised that is a personal decision that may involve religious or cultural preferences said the cdcs dr jonathan mermin but the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks added mermin who oversees the agencys programs on hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases new evidence the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised  these are the first federal guidelines on circumcision a brief medical procedure that involves cutting away the foreskin around the tip of the penis germs can grow underneath the foreskin and cdc officials say the procedure can lower a males risk of sexuallytransmitted diseases penile cancer and even urinary tract infections the cdc started working on the guidelines about seven years ago when a cluster of influential studies in africa indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the aids virus the benefits of male circumcision have become more and more clear over the last ten years said dr aaron tobian a johns hopkins university researcher involved in one of the african studies but the guidelines are important because the rates of newborn male circumcision have been dropping he added the guidelines are being published in the federal register tuesday for the next 45 days the cdc will receive public comment before finalizing them next year they are likely to draw intense opposition from anticircumcision advocacy groups said dr douglas diekema a seattle physician who worked on a circumcision policy statement issued by the american academy of pediatrics in 2012 this is a passionate issue for them and they feel strongly that circumcision is wrong said diekema a professor of pediatrics at the university of washington the cdc guidelines largely mirror the pediatrician groups statement but the cdcs document incorporates more research and comes from an organization that many may see as more neutral on the topic diekema said the thinking on circumcision has swung wildly over the years its been practiced by jews and muslims for thousands of years but didnt become common in this country until the 20th century by one estimate only 25per cent of us male newborns were circumcised in 1900 it gradually became the cultural norm and in the 1950s and 1960s surpassed 80per cent but then the trend reversed part of it had to do with changing demographics as the us population grew to include larger numbers of mexicanamericans and other ethnic groups that didnt traditionally circumcise their children controversial the new guidelines which state how the procedure can cut risk for hiv stds and penile cancer are expected to draw intense opposition from anticircumcision advocacy groups  also opposition to the procedure grew from advocates who decried the pain bleeding and risk of infections to newborns their message was aided by the internet and by the neutral stance of physicians groups  including for a time the american academy of pediatrics a wave of state medicaid programs stopped paying for newborn circumcisions which cost roughly 150 to 200 the list eventually rose to 18 states according to cdc numbers by 2010 the newborn circumcision rate was down to about 58per cent according to one cdc estimate but even as the circumcision rate dropped more medical evidence came in supporting it  particularly three rigorous and influential studies in africa that looked at the spread of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases in circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners in the new guidelines the cdc says there is now strong evidence that male circumcision can  studies have not shown that circumcision will reduce an hivinfected mans chances of spreading the aids virus to women and research has not found circumcision to be a help in stopping spread of hiv during gay sex the guidelines say circumcision is safer for newborns and infants than for older males noting the complication rate rises from 05per cent in newborns to nine per cent in children ages one to nine according to the cdc minor bleeding and pain are the most common problems experts say cdc officials are recommending doctors tell parents of baby boys of the benefits and risks of circumcision mermin did not say how that information should be presented because circumcision can be beneficial to men as well the cdc says information about the procedure also should be given to sexually active uncircumcised men  especially men considered to be at higher risk of catching hiv the guidelines say,"these are the first federal guidelines on circumcision 
the brief procedure involves cutting away the foreskin around the tip of the penis 
cdc officials say it can lower a males risk of sexuallytransmitted diseases penile cancer and even urinary tract infections 
the new guidelines are expected to draw intense opposition from anticircumcision advocacy groups 
urging health insurers to pay for the 200 procedure 
cut a mans risk of getting hiv from an infected female partner by 50 to 60per cent
reduce their risk of genital herpes and certain strains of human papillomavirus by 30per cent or more

017f9c53df71949ad526c6b1639d8c8c6677622b,cnn  as the united states weighs possible military strikes on syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack it has to consider a critical question then what a broad crosssection of experts on the region agree a missile strike could worsen the war in syria and usher in a host of new problems the key issue is not the tactics of the strikes but the strategic aftermath says anthony cordesman a former defense department official now with the center for strategic and international studies read the us governments assessment of syria  most experts believe a strike would target the syrian regimes weapons arsenal  not suspected sites of chemical weapons stockpiles the latter would be the worst possible option and could spread chemicals downwind says hamish de brettongordon a former commander of the british militarys chemical defense regiment us officials have said strikes on command bunkers airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the possibilities being considered cnn asked analysts to discuss what could follow al qaeda extremists emboldened a limited attack could suppress morale among regime forces and encourage defections and splits says jeffrey white of the washington institute for near east policy the opposition would be emboldened  including the al qaedalinked alnusra front analysts say supporting the opposition at this point would be like frenchkissing al qaeda says michael rubin a former pentagon official now with the american enterprise institute if the opposition wins al qaeda will win power there is a real risk that destabilizing the assad regime could enable the jihadist and al qaedaaffiliated rebel groups agrees erica borghard author of the policy analysis arms and influence in syria the pitfalls of greater us involvement these groups are militarily more capable than the rebels currently receiving us support  it would be difficult for the united states to target alnusra infrastructure as part of a missile strike campaign because alnusra does not operate with clear commandandcontrol assets like the regime of syrian president bashar alassad borghard says what do syrias neighbors think of potential western strikes syria steps up attacks many analysts believe a us attack would be aimed largely at making a statement that using chemical weapons in the syrian civil war is unacceptable  and that president barack obama is serious about his red line the attack would be unlikely to severely damage alassad analysts say but a limited attack brings its own dangers doing something cosmetic would be worse than doing nothing at all says christopher harmer senior naval analyst at the institute for the study of war it would send a message to alassad that he has relative immunity from us that he can continue to do whatever he wants short of massive chemical attacks on civilians harmer said in a cnn interview some other analysts fear alassad would respond with new chemical weapons attacks damaging his air force and known military installations would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival including chemical weapons to quell rebellions says ed husain of the council on foreign relations syria is now a fight to the death for both sides more than 100000 people have been killed in the syrian conflict  the vast majority through conventional weapons according to the united nations rebels officials have said 1300 people were killed in a recent chemical weapons attack the united nations has said hundreds perhaps more than a thousand were killed red line debate are chemical weapons worse the united states insists syria was behind the attack but there is no absolute certainty husain notes in a cnn opinion column syria insists it has not used chemical weapons and blames rebels if rebels did carry out the attack to bait america into the conflict then us firepower would be futile says husain no amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent nonstate actors from further use of these weapons bombing raises suspicion of another chemical attack  retaliation  against israel its unlikely syria would attack us assets analysts say they could try to shoot down us bombers if they are used but have little hope against cruise missiles says benjamin friedman of the cato institute the regimes forces are tied down against rebels and it lacks an air force or missiles that can hit any important us targets with reliability and if syria did manage to hit a us target it would only help shift us opinion toward war and invite greater us military involvement  the last thing the syrian regime wants its easier for syria to target israel but israels retaliation would bring similarly dire consequences friedman says the nightmare scenario is that assad will respond by launching chemical weapons into israel or another neighbor says rubin of the american enterprise institute after all if he hasnt batted an eye at gassing sleeping syrians why worry about killing turks jordanians or lebanese israelis have lined up in recent days for gas masks but a more likely scenario says friedman is that hezbollah would attack israel the lebanonbased terrorist militia might fire rockets into israel as they did in 2006 in response to an attack on their syria patrons that could draw the united states more deeply into the war on the other hand the memory of israels 2006 response might deter hezbollah international ramifications protests unrest attacks a missile strike on syria could lead to new violence in other parts of the middle east and around the world says firas abi ali head of middle east and north africa country risk and forecasting at ihs in lebanon hezbollah supporters would be more likely to attack sunnis due to the increased perception that sunni communities are supporting westernisraeli targeting of hezbollah and syria he says in several middle eastern countries protests could arise  some of them potentially violent in jordan syria would likely sponsor groups to attack malls hotels and government targets abi ali says and there will be a high risk of attacks sponsored by iran against western assets around the world from india to thailand to brazil abi ali says russia would also likely take action against companies based in the united states and some other countries he says who wants what syria becomes obamas war the repercussions for the united states in the eyes of the world could be tremendous analysts say by intervening syria may well prove to be obamas war bequeathed to a new president in 2016 civilian casualties are inevitable the images on our screens will not be syrians using chemical weapons to kill each other but american bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another muslim country says husain of the council on foreign relations there would be real and false claims of collateral damage and civilian deathsand at the united nations syria would accuse the united states of illegal aggression adds cordesman of the center for strategic and international studies no amount of spin and victory claims can get around these issues nothing can stop critics from validly raising every past us mistake in past interventions in the region and the world the worry here is that the us could be drawn into even more extensive involvement in syria says author borghard this could involve a number of things including imposing a nofly zone over syrian airspace andor more extensive arming and training of rebels this would be a far more resourceintense operation than the 2011 nato operation in libya and would involve greater risks still doing nothing is not an answer says cordesman  simply standing by and letting syria drift into armed violent partition will threaten every us interest in the region at the least there should be a new international humanitarian effort increased support for moderate factions in the opposition and a willingness to say the us will consider collective action in terms of some no fly zone or use of airpower to both protect and empower the rebels if they can show they really have moderate leadership can control the flow of arms and support and will give full rights and protection to their sunni opponents he says but in examining the possible repercussions of a missile strike rubin of the american enterprise institute says there is no scenario that will end violence and improve the situation the time for preventive medicine was two years ago when one side finally wins the united states will have to craft a strategy to address a whole new set of problems that such a victory will bring he says lets call where we are now phase i of the syrian civil war we have yet to see phase ii and phase iii but they are coming syria crisis latest developments,"a missile strike could worsen the war and usher in new problems 
supporting the opposition at this point would be like frenchkissing al qaeda analyst says 
hezbollah could attack israel in retaliation analysts say 
iran could sponsor attacks against western assets analyst says"

founded in 1831 by the  duke of wellington the royal united services institute is a respected  independent notforprofit research body offering expert opinion on  defence security and terrorism but questions are sure to be asked  as to how andrew can reconcile his royal role and duties with  representing an organisation however independent that is funded by  private individuals governments and corporations which include defence  manufacturers andrew flew out of the uk  accompanied by a team of  roundtheclock publiclyfunded police bodyguards  on september 16 to  jakarta where he stayed for three days the visit was apparently  designed to promote uk bilateral relations including in trade and  investment science and innovation as well as education he attended  a dinner at the ritzcarlton hotel opened the new british embassy and  attended a launch of a governmentbacked tourism initiative details  of the trip were not released until after his arrival however as  andrew is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise  his foreign travel in advance palace officials confirmed last night  that this leg of his journey was approved by the royal visits committee  at the request of the foreign office which means that all his travel  costs hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the queens  sovereign grant oneway business class flights to jakarta are just under 5000 his last official engagement was on the evening of september 19 after which andrew disappeared for a threeday weekend scrutiny the prince is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance  buckingham palace said only that he spent the time privately he then reappeared in the vietnamese capital hanoi on september 23 for a twoday stay most  notable in a series of engagements was a highlevel rusi conference  discussing ukvietnam defence cooperation and strategic issues in  southeast asia palace officials say the prince covered the cost of  this part of his trip personally his final engagement was on september  24  after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again  for five days again palace officials have declined to discuss his  movements andrew then turned up in tokyo on monday this week for  another public yet privatelyfunded series of engagements the main  thrust of the princes visit was to attend a rusi conference on  britishjapanese security cooperation where he shared the stage with  sir john scarlett former director of the security intelligence service  mi6 and japanese premier shinzo abe japan is looking to spend  billions on its defence as tensions rise with china and pressure comes  from the us for the country to become more proactive globally as a  result huge defence contracts are up for grabs according to  wellplaced sources the prince also took the opportunity to spend some  time privately with the japanese royal family after initially  refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there  buckingham palace eventually admitted  after being challenged by the  mail  that rusi had made a proportionate contribution towards his  costs the thinktank also funded him to fly on to new york on  wednesday this week ostensibly to take part in further highlevel  discussions on its behalf his arrival in manhattan coincided with  that of his youngest daughter princess eugenie who moved to the city  to work for a year for an online auction company andrew took eugenie  23 out for dinner on wednesday night at abc kitchen buckingham palace  have refused to say when the prince is returning to the uk a spokesman for the prince said he was a great admirer of the rusis work sources  stressed andrew did not receive a salary as a member of its  international advisory board and pointed out it already has  wellestablished links with the royal family in the form of the queen  who is its patron and the duke of kent its president they also  claimed that the prince  nicknamed air miles andy for his love of  travel  was taking scheduled flights throughout his trip a  spokesman for rusi said they had been keen to invite andrew to join  their advisory board as he endorsed and consolidated rusis status as a  leading independent international think tank however the latest revelations will once again shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities in  2001 he became the uks special representative for trade and  investment but he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers money the final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with  jeffrey epstein a us financier who has been jailed for soliciting  prostitution from underage girls in july 2011 andrew announced he was  standing down matthew sinclair of the taxpayers alliance said  taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the princes gallivanting  across the globe given that he is no longer a uk trade envoy it is  imperative that the prince is open and transparent about exactly how he  has spent taxpayers cash,"think tank royal united services institute subsidised princes expenses

no decent bus service to get him to where he wants to go either i set our attendance standard by this man said his boss todd wilson to the detroit free press wilson is plant manager at highend plastic

cant get here  bull hes never missed ive seen him come in here wringing wet said wilson 53 to watch video in full click here  robertson claims he powers his marathonlike commutes by drinking two liters of mountain dew and countless cans of coke each day i sleep a lot on the weekend yes i do he said but i cant imagine not working although the commute getting into work is grueling things are worse on the way back as robertson has to walk the streets alone in the dark and freezing cold none of his coworkers lives anywhere near him so catching a ride almost never happens faith im not saying im a member of some church but just before i get home every night i say lord keep me safe mr robertson says  his colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that robertson has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it i keep a rhythm in my head he says im not saying im a member of some church but just before i get home every night i say lord keep me safe

the walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including highland park and the infamous 8 mile area robertson says he was mugged once but doesnt like to talk about the incident four hours later he is back home to catch some shuteye before the longdistance commute begins all over again the following afternoon the last five years been really tough because the buses cut back robertson said once he gets to troy and detroit robertson can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car he says that its not just the 1700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly coworkers whom he calls family the bosss wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him homecooked meals each evening too grueling after repeated cutbacks in bus service the walking segments of his daily commute now takes more time than he spends in his eighthour factory shift for robertson its a chance to catchup on some  sleep  on several occasions a banker driving the exact same route has given robertson a ride blake pollock 47 of rochester said he saw robertson over and over in various

to see if he can offer him a lift knowing what i know i cant drive past him now im in my car with the heat blasting and even then my feet are cold pollock said of course all that may now be about to change after tens of thousands of dollars were raised for him in an online campaign robertson said sunday he was flattered by the attention hed gotten for his tenacious treks after the he made front page news in a local newspaper he said he was amazed that complete strangers would respond so generously with some even offering to buy him a brand new car evan leedy 19 of macomb township a wsu
