# Brief

**Brief** is an iOS app designed to simplify how users save and engage with articles. By leveraging Apple’s native frameworks like **Core ML**, **Natural Language**, and **SiriKit**, Brief aims to provide concise summaries of saved content, along with a simple, intuitive note-taking experience.

This project is both a personal challenge and a learning journey. Inspired by tutorials like Peter Friese’s [Second Brain](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsnLd2esiGRTmfGZcZMnEy6hkBHXBH_en&si=gOZhnR84skKJpUBb) app, I decided to take a different route, focusing on Apple’s native stack to create an app that feels deeply integrated into the ecosystem. While this might push the limits of my current skills, it’s a journey I’m excited to share.

Whether successful or not, I hope this project serves as a source of learning and inspiration for others.

## Features

- **Save Articles**: Users can save articles from Safari or other apps directly into Brief.
- **Article Summaries**: Using Apple's **Natural Language** and **Core ML** frameworks, Brief aims to summarize saved articles to provide concise and meaningful insights.
- **Note-Taking**: A built-in feature allowing users to jot down thoughts or insights while reading.
- **Voice Integration**: Exploring the potential of **SiriKit** to enable users to ask Siri for a summary of saved articles.

## Challenges and Goals

I recognize that building an app of this complexity isn’t easy, especially with the goal of using Apple’s frameworks as natively as possible. However, I’m excited to explore the following:

1. Integrating **Share Extensions** to allow users to save articles from Safari into the app.
2. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for article summarization.
3. Implementing a seamless user experience for note-taking.
4. Experimenting with **SiriKit** to bring voice-powered summaries to life.

While there’s no guarantee of success, I believe in learning through the process and iterating on what works.

## Why Native?

There are countless tools and libraries available, but I want Brief to feel deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem. By leveraging native frameworks like **Core ML**, **Natural Language**, and **SiriKit**, I hope to create an app that feels seamless and intuitive for iOS users while challenging myself to grow as a developer.
